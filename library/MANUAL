 SWI-Prolog  is  a Prolog  implementation based  on a  subset of
 the  WAM (Warren Abstract  Machine).   SWI-Prolog was developed
 as  an  _o_p_e_n  Prolog  environment,  providing  a  powerful  and
 bi-directional  interface  to  C in  an  era  this was  unknown
 to   other  Prolog  implementations.      This  environment  is
 required  to  deal  with XPCE,  an  object-oriented  GUI system
 developed  at SWI. XPCE is  used at SWI for  the development of
 knowledge-intensive graphical applications.

 As  SWI-Prolog  became  more  popular,  a large  user-community
 provided  requirements that  guided its  development.   Compat-
 ibility,  portability,   scalability,  stability and  providing
 a   powerful  development   environment  have  been   the  most
 important  requirements.     Edinburgh,  Quintus,  SICStus  and
 the  ISO-standard  guide  the  development  of  the  SWI-Prolog
 primitives.

 This  document gives an overview of the features, system limits
 and built-in predicates.

SWI-Prolog  has   been  designed  and  implemented   to  get  a   Prolog
implementation which can be used for experiments  with logic programming
and  the  relation  to other  programming  paradigms.     The  intention
was  to  build  a Prolog  environment  which  offers  enough  power  and
flexibility to  write substantial applications,  but is  straightforward
enough to  be modified for experiments  with debugging, optimisation  or
the introduction of  non-standard data types.  Performance  optimisation
is  limited due  to the  main objectives:    portability (SWI-Prolog  is
entirely written in C and Prolog) and modifiability.

SWI-Prolog  is based  on  a very  restricted  form  of the  WAM  (Warren
Abstract Machine) described  in [Bowen & Byrd, 1983] which defines  only
7  instructions.   Prolog  can  easily be  compiled into  this  language
and the  abstract machine code  is easily  decompiled back into  Prolog.
As  it is  also  possible to  wire a  standard  4-port debugger  in  the
WAM interpreter  there is  no need  for a  distinction between  compiled
and interpreted  code.   Besides  simplifying the design  of the  Prolog
system  itself this  approach has  advantages  for program  development:
the  compiler is  simple and  fast, the  user  does not  have to  decide
in  advance whether  debugging  is required  and  the system  only  runs
slightly  slower when  in debug  mode.   The  price we  have  to pay  is
some  performance degradation  (taking  out the  debugger from  the  WAM
interpreter improves performance  by about 20%) and somewhat  additional
memory usage to help the decompiler and debugger.

SWI-Prolog  extends  the  minimal  set  of   instructions  described  in
[Bowen & Byrd, 1983]  to improve  performance.    While  extending  this
set care  has been  taken to  maintain the  advantages of  decompilation
and  tracing of  compiled  code.    The extensions  include  specialised
instructions  for unification,  predicate  invocation,  some  frequently
used built-in  predicates, arithmetic, and  control (;/2, |/2),  if-then
(->/2) and negation-by-failure (\+/1).

This manual does not  describe the full syntax and semantics  of Prolog,
nor how  one should  write a  program in Prolog.    These subjects  have
been  described extensively  in  the literature.    See  [Bratko, 1986],
[Sterling & Shapiro, 1986],   and   [Clocksin & Melish, 1987].       For
more  advanced  Prolog   material  see  [OKeefe, 1990].     Syntax   and
standard  operator declarations  confirm  to the  `Edinburgh  standard'.
Most  built  in  predicates  are  compatible  with  those  described  in
[Clocksin & Melish, 1987].      SWI-Prolog  also  offers  a  number   of
primitive  predicates compatible  with  Quintus Prolog  [Qui, 1997]  and
BIM_Prolog [BIM, 1989].

ISO  compliant  predicates  are based  on  ``Prolog:    The  Standard'',
[Deransart _e_t _a_l_., 1996], validated using [??].


11..22 SSttaattuuss

This manual describes  version 4.0 of SWI-Prolog.   SWI-Prolog has  been
used now for many  years.  The application range includes  Prolog course
material,  meta-interpreters, simulation  of parallel  Prolog,  learning
systems,  natural  language processing  and  two large  workbenches  for
knowledge  engineering.    Although we  experienced rather  obvious  and
critical bugs  can remain  unnoticed for  a remarkable  long period,  we
assume the basic Prolog  system is fairly stable.  Bugs can  be expected
in infrequently used built-in predicates.

Some bugs are known to  the author.  They are described as  footnotes in
this manual.

SWI-Prolog 3.3.0 implements  all predicates described in ``Prolog:   The
Standard'' [Deransart _e_t _a_l_., 1996].

Exceptions  and warning  are still  weak.    Some SWI-Prolog  predicates
silently  fail on  conditions where  the ISO  specification requires  an
exception  (functor/3 for  example).    Many predicates  print  warnings
rather than raising an  exception.  All predicates where  exceptions may
be  caused due  to a  correct program  operating in  an imperfect  world
(I/O, arithmetic,  resource overflows)  should behave  according to  the
ISO standard.   In other  words:  SWI-Prolog  should be able to  execute
any program  conforming to [Deransart _e_t _a_l_., 1996]  that does not  rely
on exceptions generated by errors in the program.

There are a number of reasons why you better  choose a commercial Prolog
system, or another academic product:

  o _S_W_I_-_P_r_o_l_o_g _i_s _n_o_t _s_u_p_p_o_r_t_e_d
    Although  I usually fix bugs shortly  after a bug report arrives,  I
    cannot  promise anything.   Now that the  sources are provided,  you
    can always dig into them yourself.

  o _M_e_m_o_r_y _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_s _a_n_d _p_e_r_f_o_r_m_a_n_c_e _a_r_e _y_o_u_r _f_i_r_s_t _c_o_n_c_e_r_n_s
    A  number  of  commercial compilers  are  more  keen on  memory  and
    performance  than SWI-Prolog.   I do not  wish to sacrifice some  of
    the  nice features of the system, nor its portability to  compete on
    raw performance.

  o _Y_o_u _n_e_e_d _f_e_a_t_u_r_e_s _n_o_t _o_f_f_e_r_e_d _b_y _S_W_I_-_P_r_o_l_o_g
    In  this case you  may wish to  give me suggestions for  extensions.
    If  you  have great  plans, please  contact me  (you  might have  to
    implement them yourself however).

On the other hand, SWI-Prolog offers some nice facilities:

  o _N_i_c_e _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t
    This includes `Do  What I Mean', automatic completion of atom names,
    history mechanism and  a tracer that operates on single key-strokes.
    Interfaces  to  some  standard  editors are  provided  (and  can  be
    extended), as well as a facility to maintain programs (see make/0).

  o _V_e_r_y _f_a_s_t _c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r
    Even  very  large applications  can  be loaded  in seconds  on  most
    machines.  If  this is not enough, there is a Quick Load Format that
    is slightly more compact and loading is almost always I/O bound.

  o _T_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t _c_o_m_p_i_l_e_d _c_o_d_e
    SWI-Prolog  compiled code can be  treated just as interpreted  code:
    you  can list it, trace  it, etc.  This  implies you do not have  to
    decide  beforehand whether a module  should be loaded for  debugging
    or  not.  Also, performance  is much better than the  performance of
    most interpreters.

  o _P_r_o_f_i_l_i_n_g
    SWI-Prolog offers tools  for performance analysis, which can be very
    useful  to optimise  programs.   Unless you  are very familiar  with
    Prolog  and Prolog  performance  considerations this  might be  more
    helpful than a better compiler without these facilities.

  o _F_l_e_x_i_b_i_l_i_t_y
    SWI-Prolog  can  easily   be  integrated  with  C,  supporting  non-
    determinism  in Prolog calling  C as well  as C calling Prolog  (see
    section  5.  It can  also be _e_m_b_e_d_d_e_d embedded in external  programs
    (see  section 5.7).  System  predicates can be redefined locally  to
    provide compatibility with other Prolog systems.

  o _I_n_t_e_g_r_a_t_i_o_n _w_i_t_h _X_P_C_E
    SWI-Prolog   offers  a   tight  integration  to   the  Object   Ori-
    ented   Package  for   User  Interface   Development,  called   XPCE
    [Anjewierden & Wielemaker, 1989].    XPCE  allows you  to  implement
    graphical  user  interfaces  that are  source-code  compatible  over
    Unix/X11 and Win32 (Windows 95 and NT).

The  XPCE GUI  system  for dynamically  typed  languages has  been  with
SWI-Prolog for  a long time.   It is  developed by Anjo Anjewierden  and
Jan  Wielemaker from  the department  of SWI,  University of  Amsterdam.
It  aims at  a  high-productive  development environment  for  graphical
applications based on Prolog.

Object  oriented  technology has  proven  to  be a  suitable  model  for
implementing GUIs, which  typically deal with things Prolog is  not very
good  at:   event-driven  control  and global  state.    With  XPCE,  we
designed  a system  that has  similar characteristics  that make  Prolog
such  a powerful  tool:   dynamic typing,  meta-programming and  dynamic
modification of the running system.

XPCE is  an object-system written  in the C-language.   It provides  for
the implementation of methods  in multiple languages.  New  XPCE classes
may be defined from Prolog using a simple, natural syntax.   The body of
the method is executed  by Prolog itself, providing a  natural interface
between the two systems.  Below is a very simple class definition.

:- pce_begin_class(prolog_lister, frame,
                   "List Prolog predicates").

initialise(Self) :->
        "As the C++ constructor"::
        send(Self, send_super, initialise, 'Prolog Lister'),
        send(Self, append, new(D, dialog)),
        send(D, append,
             text_item(predicate, message(Self, list, @arg1))),
        send(new(view), below, D).

list(Self, From:name) :->
        "List predicates from specification"::
        (   catch(term_to_atom(Term, From), _, fail)
        ->  get(Self, member, view, V),
            pce_open(V, write, Fd),
            set_output(Fd),
            listing(Term),
            close(Fd)
        ;   send(Self, report, error, 'Syntax error')
        ).

:- pce_end_class.

test :- send(new(prolog_lister), open).

Its  165  built-in   classes  deal  with  the  meta-environment,   data-
representation  and---of  course---graphics.     The   graphics  classes
concentrate on direct-manipulation of diagrammatic representations.

AAvvaaiillaabbiilliittyy.. XPCE runs  on most  Unixtm platforms, Windows  95, 98  and
Windows NT. It has been connected to SWI-Prolog, SICStustm and Quintustm
Prolog as well  as some Lisp dialects and  C++.  The Quintus version  is
commercially distributed and supported as ProWindows-3tm.

    Redefinition  of system  predicates  was allowed  silently in  older

  o _`_A_n_s_w_e_r_' _r_e_u_s_e
    The  toplevel maintains  a table  of bindings  returned by  toplevel

    `Simple'  foreign predicates no  longer build a Prolog  stack-frame,
    but are directly  called from the VM. Notably provides a speedup for
    the test predicates such as var/1, etc.

    All  SWI-Prolog's I/O is now  handled by the stream-package  defined
    in  the foreign include file SWI-Stream.h.   Physical I/O of  Prolog
    streams  may be  redefined through the  foreign language  interface,
    facilitating much simpler integration in window environments.

Version  2.5  is  an  intermediate release  on  the  path  from  2.1  to
3.0.    All  changes are  to  the foreign-language  interface,  both  to
user- and system-predicates implemented  in the C-language.  The  aim is
twofold.   First of all  to make garbage-collection and  stack-expansion
(stack-shifts)  possible  while  foreign  code  is  active  without  the
C-programmer having  to worry  about locking  and unlocking  C-variables
pointing  to Prolog  terms.    The new  approach is  closely  compatible
to the  Quintus and  SICStus Prolog  foreign interface  using the  +term
argument specification (see their respective manuals).   This allows for
writing foreign  interfaces that  are easily portable  over these  three
Prolog platforms.

Apart from  various bug fixes  listed in the  Changelog file, these  are
the main changes since 2.1.0:

  o _I_S_O _c_o_m_p_a_t_i_b_i_l_i_t_y
    Many   ISO  compatibility  features   have  been  added:     open/4,
    arithmetic functions, syntax, etc.

  o _W_i_n_3_2
    Many  fixes for the Win32 (NT,  '95 and win32s) platforms.   Notably
    many  problems related  to pathnames  and a problem  in the  garbage
    collector.

  o _P_e_r_f_o_r_m_a_n_c_e
    Many  changes to  the clause  indexing system:   added  hash-tables,
    lazy computation of the index information, etc.

  o _P_o_r_t_a_b_l_e _s_a_v_e_d_-_s_t_a_t_e_s
    The   predicate  qsave_program/[1,2] allows  for   the  creating  of
    machine independent saved-states that load very quickly.

Version 2.6  provides a stable implementation  of the features added  in
the 2.5.x  releases, but  at the same  time implements  a number of  new
features that may have impact on the system stability.

  o _3_2_-_b_i_t _i_n_t_e_g_e_r _a_n_d _d_o_u_b_l_e _f_l_o_a_t _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c
    The  biggest change is the  support for full 32-bit signed  integers
    and  raw  machine-format  double precision  floats.    The  internal
    data  representation as well as  the arithmetic instruction set  and
    interface to the arithmetic functions has been changed for this.

  o _E_m_b_e_d_d_i_n_g _f_o_r _W_i_n_3_2 _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s
    The  Win32 version has been reorganised.   The Prolog kernel is  now
    implemented  as Win32  DLL that may  be embedded in  C-applications.
    Two front ends  are provided, one for window-based operation and one
    to run as a Win32 console application.

  o _C_r_e_a_t_i_n_g _s_t_a_n_d_-_a_l_o_n_e _e_x_e_c_u_t_a_b_l_e_s
    Version  2.6.0 can create  stand-alone executables by attaching  the
    saved-state to the emulator.  See qsave_program/2.

Version 2.7  reorganises the  entire data-representation  of the  Prolog
data  itself.   The  aim is  to remove  most of  the  assumption on  the
machine's memory  layout to  improve portability in  general and  enable
embedding on  systems where the memory  layout may depend on  invocation
or on how the executable is linked.  The latter  is notably a problem on
the Win32 platforms.  Porting to 64-bit architectures is feasible now.

Furthermore, 2.7 lifts the  limits on arity of predicates and  number of
variables in  a clause considerably and  allow for further expansion  at
minimal cost.

With version  2.8, we declare  the data-representation changes of  2.7.x
stable.   Version  2.8 exploits  the changes  of 2.7  to support  64-bit
processors like the DEC Alpha.  As of  version 2.8.5, the representation
of  recorded  terms  has  changed,  and  terms   on  the  heap  are  now
represented  in a  compiled format.    SWI-Prolog no  longer limits  the

Version  2.9  is  the next  step  towards  version  3.0,  improving  ISO
compliance  and introducing  ISO  compliant  exception handling.     New
are catch/3, throw/1, abolish/1, write_term/[2,3], write_canonical/[1,2]
and  the C-functions  PL_exception() and  PL_throw().    The  predicates
display/[1,2] and displayq/[1,2]  have been moved to  library(backcomp),
so old code referring to them will autoload them.

The interface  to PL_open_query() has changed.    The _d_e_b_u_g argument  is
replaced  by a  bitwise or'ed  _f_l_a_g_s argument.    The  values FALSE  and
TRUE have their familiar meaning, making old code  using these constants
compatible.   Non-zero values  other than TRUE  (1) will be  interpreted
different.

Improvements   on  exception-handling.       Allows  relating   software
interrupts (signals)  to exceptions,  handling signals in  Prolog and  C
(see on_signal/3  and PL_signal()).   Prolog stack  overflows now  raise
the resource_error  exception and thus  can be handled  in Prolog  using
catch/3.

Version 3.3  is a  major release,  changing many  things internally  and
externally.   The highlights are a  complete redesign of the  high-level
I/O system, which is  now based on explicit streams rather  then current
input/output.  The  old Edinburgh predicates (see/1, tell/1, etc.)   are
now defined on top of this layer instead of the other  way around.  This
fixes various internal problems and removes Prolog limits  on the number
of streams.

Much  progress  has been  made  to  improve ISO  compliance:    handling
strings  as  lists  of  one-character  atoms  is   now  supported  (next
to  character   codes  as  integers).      Many  more  exceptions   have
been  added and  printing  of exceptions  and messages  is  rationalised
using   Quintus   and   SICStus   Prolog   compatible   print_message/2,
message_hook/3 and print_message_lines/3.   All predicates descriped  in
[Deransart _e_t _a_l_., 1996] are now implemented.

As of version  3.3, SWI-Prolog adheres the  ISO _l_o_g_i_c_a_l _u_p_d_a_t_e _v_i_e_w  for
dynamic predicates.  See section 3.13.1 for details.

SWI-Prolog  3.3  includes garbage  collection  on  atoms,  removing  the
last serious memory  leak especially in text-manipulation  applications.
See  section 5.6.2.1.    In addition,  both the  user-level and  foreign
interface supports atoms holding _0_-_b_y_t_e_s.

Finally, an  alpha version of a  multi-threaded SWI-Prolog for Linux  is
added.    This version  is still  much slower  than the  single-threaded
version due  to frequent access to  `thread-local-data' as well as  some
too detailed  mutex locks.   The basic thread  API is ready for  serious
use and testing however.  See section 3.39.

A number  of incompatible changes  result from this upgrade.   They  are
all easily fixed however.

  o !/0_, call/1
    The  cut now behaves  according to the ISO  standard.  This  implies
    it  works in compound  goals passed  to call/1 and  is local to  the
    _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n part of if-then-else as well as the argument of \+/1.

  o atom_chars/2
    This  predicate  is now  ISO  compliant and  thus generates  a  list
    of  one-character atoms.    The behaviour  of the  old predicate  is
    available  in the  ---also ISO compliant---  atom_codes/2 predicate.
    Safest  repair is a  replacement of all  atom_chars  into atom_codes.
    If you do not want to change any souce-code, you might want to use

    user:goal_expansion(atom_chars(A,B), atom_codes(A,B)).

  o number_chars/2
    Same applies for number_chars/2 and number_codes/2.

  o feature/2_, set_feature/2
    These  are  replaced  by  the  ISO  compliant  current_prolog_flag/2
    and  set_prolog_flag/2.    The  library  library(backcomp)  provides
    definitions for  feature/2 and set_feature/2, so no  source hhaass to be
    updated.

  o _A_c_c_e_s_s_i_n_g _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_l_i_n_e _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s
    This  used  to   be  provided  by  the  undocumented  '$argv'/1  and
    Quintus  compatible library unix/1.   Now  there is also  documented
    current_prolog_flag(_a_r_g_v_, _A_r_g_v).

  o dup_stream/2
    Has  been deleted.   New  stream-aliases can deal  with most of  the
    problems  for which  dup_stream/2 was  designed and  dup/2 from  the
    _c_l_i_b package can with most others.

  o op/3
    Operators  are now llooccaall ttoo mmoodduulleess.  This implies  any modification
    of  the operator-table does  not influence other  modules.  This  is
    consistent  with the proposed ISO behaviour and a necessity  to have
    any usable handling of operators in a multi-threaded environment.

  o _s_e_t___p_r_o_l_o_g___f_l_a_g_(_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r___e_s_c_a_p_e_s_, _B_o_o_l_)
    This  prolog flag is now an interface to changing attributes  on the
    current source-module,  effectively making this flag module-local as
    well.   This is required for consistent handling of  sources written
    with  ISO (obligatory) character-escape sequences together  with old
    Edinburgh code.

  o current_stream/3 _a_n_d _s_t_r_e_a_m___p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n
    These predicates have been moved to library(quintus).

The  3.4 release  is  a consolidation  release.    It  consolidates  the
improvements  and  standard conformance  of  the  3.3 releases.     This
version  is closely  compatible  with the  3.3  version except  for  one
important change:

  o _A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t _o_r_d_e_r _i_n select/3
    The  list-processing  predicate select/3  somehow  got into  a  very
    early  version of SWI-Prolog  with the wrong  argument order.   This
    has been fixed in  3.4.0.  The correct order is select(?Elem, ?List,
    ?Rest).

    As  select/3  has  no  error  conditions,  runtime  checking  cannot
    be   done.       To   simplify   debugging,   the   library   module
    library(checkselect)  will  print  references to  select/3  in  your
    source  code  and  install  a  version of  select  that  enters  the
    debugger if select is called and the second argument is not a list.

    This   library   can   be   loaded   explicitely   or   by   calling
    check_old_select/0.

As of  version 4.0 the  standard distribution  of SWI-Prolog is  bundled
with a  number of its  popular extension packages,  among which the  now
open source XPCE GUI toolkit (see section 1.5).   No significant changes
have been made to the basic SWI-Prolog engine.

Some useful tricks in the integrated environment:

  o _R_e_g_i_s_t_e_r _t_h_e _G_U_I _t_r_a_c_e_r
    Using  a call to guitracer/0,  hooks are installed that replace  the
    normal command-line driven tracer with a graphical forntend.

  o _R_e_g_i_s_t_e_r _P_c_e_E_m_a_c_s _f_o_r _e_d_i_t_i_n_g _f_i_l_e_s
    From    your   initialisation   file.        you   can    load   li-
    brary(emacs/swi_prolog)  that  cause  edit/1  to  use  the  built-in
    PceEmacs editor.

Some  small  parts  of  the  Prolog  code  of  SWI-Prolog  are  modified
versions of  the corresponding  Edinburgh C-Prolog code:   grammar  rule
compilation  and writef/2.    Also some  of the  C-code originates  from
C-Prolog:  finding the path of the currently running  executable and the
code underlying  absolute_file_name/2.   Ideas  on programming style  and
techniques originate from  C-Prolog and Richard O'Keefe's _t_h_i_e_f  editor.
An  important  source  of inspiration  are  the  programming  techniques
introduced by Anjo Anjewierden in PCE version 1 and 2.

I also  would like to thank  those who had the  fade of using the  early
versions of this system,  suggested extensions or reported bugs.   Among
them are Anjo Anjewierden, Huub Knops, Bob  Wielinga, Wouter Jansweijer,
Luc Peerdeman, Eric Nombden, Frank van Harmelen, Bert Rengel.

Martin Jansche  (jansche@novell1.gs.uni-heidelberg.de) has been so  kind
to reorganise the sources for version 2.1.3 of this manual.

Horst  von Brand  has been  so  kind to  fix many  typos  in the  2.7.14
manual.  Thanks!

By default, SWI-Prolog is installed as `pl',  though some administrators
call  it  `swipl'  or `swi-prolog'.     The  command-line  arguments  of
SWI-Prolog  itself  and  its  utility  programs   are  documented  using
standard  Unix  man pages.     SWI-Prolog  is normally  operated  as  an
interactive application simply by starting the program:

machine% pl

Copyright (c) 1990-2000 University of Amsterdam.
Copy policy: GPL-2 (see www.gnu.org)

For help, use ?- help(Topic). or ?- apropos(Word).

1 ?-

After  starting Prolog,  one  normally loads  a  program into  it  using
consult/1,  which---for  historical  reasons---may   be  abbreviated  by
putting the  name of  the program  file between  square brackets.    The
following  goal loads  the  file  likes.pl containing  clauses  for  the
predicates likes/2:

?- [likes].
% likes compiled, 0.00 sec, 596 bytes.

After this point, Unix and Windows users are united again.

After SWI-Prolog has been  installed on a Windows system,  the following
important new things are available to the user:

  o A  folder  (called  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y in  the  remainder of  this  document)
    called  pl  containing the  executables,  libraries, etc.    of  the
    system.  No files are installed outside this directory.

  o A  program  plwin.exe,  providing  a  window  for  interaction  with
    Prolog.  The  program plcon.exe is a version of SWI-Prolog that runs
    in a DOS-box.

  o The  file-extension .pl  is associated with  the program  plwin.exe.
    Opening  a .pl file will cause plwin.exe to start,  change directory
    to  the directory in  which the file-to-open  resides and load  this
    file.

The  normal   way  to  start  with   the  likes.pl  file  mentioned   in
section 2.1.1.1  is by simply double-clicking  this file in the  Windows
explorer.

After loading a program,  one can ask Prolog queries about  the program.
The query below  asks Prolog to prove  whether `john' likes someone  and
who is  liked by  `john'.   The system  responds with X = <_v_a_l_u_e> if  it
can prove  the goal for a  certain _X. The  user can type the  semi-colon
(;) if  (s)he wants another solution,  or return if (s)he is  satisfied,
after which Prolog will say YYeess.  If Prolog answers  NNoo, it indicates it
cannot find any more  answers to the query.  Finally, Prolog  can answer
using an  error message  to indicate  the query or  program contains  an
error.

?- likes(john, X).

X = mary

After  the necessary  system  initialisation  the system  consults  (see
consult/1) the user's startup file.  The base-name  of this file follows
conventions of  the operating  system.   On MS-Windows,  it is the  file
pl.ini  and on  Unix systems  .plrc.   The  file is  searched using  the
file_search_path/2 clauses for user_profile.  The table below  shows the
default value for this search-path.

After the  first startup  file is found  it is  loaded and Prolog  stops
looking for further startup files.  The name of the  startup file can be
changed with the  `-f file' option.   If _F_i_l_e denotes an absolute  path,
this file is loaded,  otherwise the file is searched for using  the same
conventions as for the default startup file.  Finally,  if _f_i_l_e is none,
no file is loaded.

Using  commandline  arguments  (see  section  2.4),  SWI-Prolog  can  be
forced to  load files  and execute queries  for initialisation  purposes
or  non-interactive operation.    The  most  commonly used  options  are
-f file or  -s file to  make Prolog load  a file,  -g goal to define  an
initialisation  goal and  -t goal to  define  the _t_o_p_l_e_v_e_l  _g_o_a_l.    The
following  is a  typical example  for starting  an application  directly
from the commandline.

machine% pl -f load.pl -g go -t halt

It tells  SWI-Prolog to load  load.pl, start  the application using  the
_e_n_t_r_y_-_p_o_i_n_t go/0 and ---instead of entering  the interactive toplevel---
exit  after completing  go/0.    The  -q  may  be used  to  supress  all
informational messages.

In  MS-Windows,  the  same  can  be  achieved  using  a  short-cut  with
appropriately  defined  commandline   arguments.     A  typically   seen
alternative  is to  write  a file  run.pl  with content  as  illustrated
below.  Double-clicking run.pl will start the application.

:- [load].                      % load program
:- go.                          % run it
:- halt.                        % and exit

Section  2.10.2.1 discusses  further  scripting  options and  chapter  6
discusses the  generation of runtime executables.   Runtime  executables
are  a mean  to  deliver executables  that  do  not require  the  Prolog
system.

The full set of command line options is given below:

--hheellpp
    When  given as  the only  option, it summarises  the most  important
    options.

--vv
    When  given as the  only option, it  summarises the version and  the
    architecture identifier.

--aarrcchh
    When   given  as  the  only  option,  it  prints   the  architecture
    identifier  (see  current_prolog_flag(arch,  Arch)) and  exits.    See
    also -dump-runtime-variables.

--dduummpp--rruunnttiimmee--vvaarriiaabblleess
    When  given as  the only option,  it prints  a sequence of  variable
    settings  that can  be  used in  shell-scripts to  deal with  Prolog
    parameters.   This feature is  also used by plld (see section  5.7).
    Below is a typical example of using this feature.

    eval `pl -dump-runtime-variables`
    cc -I$PLBASE/include -L$PLBASE/runtime/$PLARCH ...

--qq
    Set the prolog-flag  verbose to silent, supressing informational and
    banner messages.

--LL_s_i_z_e_[_k_m_]
    Give  local stack limit (2 Mbytes default).   Note that there  is no
    space  between the size option  and its argument.   By default,  the
    argument  is interpreted in  Kbytes.   Postfixing the argument  with
    m  causes the argument to be  interpreted in Mbytes.  The  following
    example specifies 32 Mbytes local stack.

    % pl -L32m

    A maximum is  useful to stop buggy programs from claiming all memory
    resources.   -L0 sets the limit to the highest possible value.   See
    section 2.16.

--GG_s_i_z_e_[_k_m_]
    Give  global  stack limit  (4 Mbytes  default).    See -L  for  more
    details.

--TT_s_i_z_e_[_k_m_]
    Give  trail  stack  limit  (4  Mbytes  default).     This  limit  is
    relatively  high because trail-stack overflows are not  often caused
    by program bugs.  See -L for more details.

--AA_s_i_z_e_[_k_m_]
    Give  argument stack limit (1 Mbytes  default).  The argument  stack
    limits  the  maximum  nesting of  terms  that  can be  compiled  and
    executed.    SWI-Prolog does `last-argument  optimisation' to  avoid
    many  deeply nested  structure  using this  stack.   Enlarging  this
    limit is only necessary in extreme cases.  See -L for more details.

--cc _f_i_l_e _._._.
    Compile files into an `intermediate code file'.  See section 2.10.

--oo _o_u_t_p_u_t
    Used  in combination  with -c  or -b  to determine  output file  for
    compilation.

--OO
    Optimised compilation.  See current_prolog_flag/2.

--ss _f_i_l_e
    Use  _f_i_l_e as a  script-file.   The script file  is loaded after  the
    initialisation  file  specified with  the -f file  option.    Unlike
    -f file, using

--ss _d
    oes not stop Prolog from loaded the personal initialisation file.

--ff _f_i_l_e
    Use _f_i_l_e as  initialisation file instead of the default .plrc (Unix)
    or pl.ini (Windows).   `-f none' stops SWI-Prolog from searching for
    a  startup file.    This option  can be  used as  an alternative  to
    -s file  that stops Prolog from loading the  personal initialisation
    file.  See also section 2.2.

--FF _s_c_r_i_p_t
    Selects  a startup-script from the  SWI-Prolog home directory.   The
    script-file  is  named <_s_c_r_i_p_t>.rc.    The  default _s_c_r_i_p_t  name  is
    deduced  from  the  executable,  taking the  leading  alphanumerical
    characters  (letters, digits and underscore) from  the program-name.
    -F none stops looking  for a script.  Intended for simple management
    of  slightly  different  versions.    One  could for  example  write
    a  script  iso.rc  and  then select  ISO  compatibility  mode  using
    pl -F iso or make a link from iso-pl to pl.

--gg _g_o_a_l
    _G_o_a_l  is executed just before entering the top level.  Default  is a
    predicate  which prints the  welcome message.   The welcome  message
    can  thus be suppressed by  giving -g true.   _g_o_a_l can be a  complex
    term.   In this case quotes  are normally needed to protect  it from
    being expanded by the Unix shell.

--tt _g_o_a_l
    Use  _g_o_a_l  as  interactive  toplevel instead  of  the  default  goal
    prolog/0.    _g_o_a_l  can be  a complex  term.   If  the toplevel  goal
    succeeds  SWI-Prolog exits  with status  0.   If it  fails the  exit
    status  is  1.    This  flag also  determines  the goal  started  by
    break/0  and abort/0.   If you want to  stop the user from  entering
    interactive  mode  start the  application  with `-g goal'  and  give
    `halt' as toplevel.

    Define  a path  alias for  file_search_path.    _a_l_i_a_s is  the name  of
    the  alias, _p_a_t_h_1  _._._.   is  a : separated  list of  values for  the
    alias.    A  value is  either a  term of  the  form alias(value)  or
    pathname.    The  computed aliases  are added  to file_search_path/2
    using  asserta/1, so they precede  predefined values for the  alias.
    See  file_search_path/2  for details  on  using  this  file-location
    mechanism.

The default  Prolog mode for  GNU-Emacs can be  activated by adding  the
following rules to your Emacs initialisation file:

(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append
       '(("\\.pl" . prolog-mode))
       auto-mode-alist))
(setq prolog-program-name "pl")
(setq prolog-consult-string "[user].\n")
;If you want this.  Indentation is either poor or I don't use
;it as intended.
;(setq prolog-indent-width 8)

Unfortunately the  default Prolog mode  of GNU-Emacs  is not very  good.
An  alternative  prolog.el  file for  GNU-Emacs  20  is  available  from
http://www.freesoft.cz/ pdm/software/emacs/prolog-mode/  and  for   GNU-

Online  help  provides a  fast  lookup  and browsing  facility  to  this
manual.   The online  manual can show predicate  definitions as well  as
entire sections of the manual.

The online help  is displayed from the file library('MANUAL').  The file
library(helpidx) provides  an index into this  file.   library('MANUAL')
is created  from the LaTeX  sources with a  modified version of  dvitty,
using overstrike  for printing bold text  and underlining for  rendering
italic  text.    XPCE  is  shipped  with  library(swi_help),  presenting
the  information from  the  online help  in a  hypertext  window.    The
prolog-flag  write_help_with_overstrike controls  whether  or not  help/1
writes  its output  using  overstrike  to realise  bold  and  underlined
output or  not.   If this prolog-flag  is not set  it is initialised  by
the help  library to true  if the TERM variable  equals xterm and  false
otherwise.   If  this default does  not satisfy you,  add the  following
line to your personal startup file (see section 2.2):

:- set_prolog_flag(write_help_with_overstrike, true).

SWI-Prolog  offers a  query substitution  mechanism similar  to that  of
Unix csh (csh(1)), called  `history'.  The availability of  this feature
is controlled by  set_prolog_flag/2, using  the history prolog-flag.   By
default,  history is  available if  the prolog-flag  readline is  false.
To  enable this  feature,  remembering the  last  50 commands,  put  the
following into your startup file (see section 2.2:

:- set_prolog_flag(history, 50).

The history  system allows the  user to compose  new queries from  those
typed before and  remembered by the system.   It also allows to  correct
queries and  syntax errors.    SWI-Prolog does  not offer  the Unix  csh
capabilities to  include arguments.   This is omitted  as it is  unclear
how the first, second, etc. argument should be defined.

The available history commands are shown in table 2.1.

History expansion  is executed  after _r_a_w_-_r_e_a_d_i_n_g.   This  is the  first
stage of read_term/2 and friends,  reading the term into a  string while
deleting comment  and canonising blank.   This makes  it hard to use  it
for correcting  syntax errors.   Command-line editing as provided  using
the GNU-readline library is  more suitable for this.   History expansion
is first  of all useful  for executing or  combining commands from  long
ago.

SWI-Prolog has  a 6-port  tracer, extending the  standard 4-port  tracer
[Clocksin & Melish, 1987]  with two  additional  ports.    The  optional
_u_n_i_f_y port allows  the user to inspect  the result after unification  of
the head.  The _e_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n port shows exceptions raised  by throw/1 or one
of the built-in predicates.  See section 3.9.

The standard  ports are called call,  exit, redo, fail  and unify.   The
tracer is started  by the trace/0 command,  when a spy point is  reached
and the system is  in debugging mode (see spy/1 and debug/0) or  when an
exception is raised.

The interactive  toplevel goal trace/0 means  ``trace the next  query''.
The  tracer shows  the  port,  displaying  the port  name,  the  current
depth of  the recursion and  the goal.   The goal  is printed using  the
Prolog predicate write_term/2.  The style is defined  by the prolog-flag
debugger_print_options  and can be modified using this flag or  using the
w, p and d commands of the tracer.

On _l_e_a_s_h_e_d  _p_o_r_t_s (set  with the  predicate leash/1,  default are  call,
exit, redo and  fail) the user is prompted  for an action.  All  actions
are single character  commands which are executed wwiitthhoouutt waiting  for a
return, unless the command line option -tty is active.  Tracer options:

+ ((SSppyy))
    Set a spy point (see spy/1) on the current predicate.

- ((NNoo ssppyy))
    Remove the spy point (see nospy/1) from the current predicate.

/ ((FFiinndd))
    Search  for a port.   After the  `/', the user  can enter a line  to
    specify  the port to  search for.   This line consists  of a set  of
    letters  indicating the  port type,  followed by  an optional  term,
    that  should unify with  the goal run by  the port.   If no term  is
    specified  it is taken as a variable, searching for any port  of the
    specified  type.  If an atom is given, any goal whose  functor has a
    name equal to that atom matches.  Examples:

            /f               Search for any fail port

            /fe solve        Search for a  fail or exit  port of
                             any goal with name solve
            /c solve(a, _)   Search for a call to  solve/2 whose
                             first argument is a variable or the
                             atom a
            /a member(_, _)  Search for  any  port on  member/2.
                             This is equivalent to setting a spy
                             point on member/2.

C ((CCoonntteexxtt))
    Toggle  `Show Context'.   If on  the context module  of the goal  is
    displayed between square brackets (see section 4).  Default is off.

L ((LLiissttiinngg))
    List the current predicate with listing/1.

a ((AAbboorrtt))
    Abort Prolog execution (see abort/0).

b ((BBrreeaakk))
    Enter a Prolog break environment (see break/0).

c ((CCrreeeepp))
    Continue execution, stop at next port.  (Also return, space).

d ((DDiissppllaayy))
    Set  the max_depth(_D_e_p_t_h) option of debugger_print_options,  limiting
    the  depth  to which  terms are  printed.    See also  the  w and  p
    options.

e ((EExxiitt))
    Terminate Prolog (see halt/0).

f ((FFaaiill))
    Force failure of the current goal.

g ((GGooaallss))
    Show the list of  parent goals (the execution stack).  Note that due
    to  tail recursion optimization a  number of parent goals might  not
    exist any more.

h ((HHeellpp))
    Show available options (also `?').

i ((IIggnnoorree))
    Ignore the current goal, pretending it succeeded.

l ((LLeeaapp))
    Continue execution, stop at next spy point.

n ((NNoo ddeebbuugg))
    Continue execution in `no debug' mode.

p ((PPrriinntt))
    Set   the   prolog-flag  debugger_print_options  to   [quoted(true),
    portray(true), max_depth(10)].  This is the default.

r ((RReettrryy))
    Undo  all actions (except for database and i/o actions) back  to the
    call  port of  the current  goal and  resume execution  at the  call
    port.

s ((SSkkiipp))
    Continue  execution,  stop  at the  next  port  of tthhiiss  goal  (thus
    skipping all calls to children of this goal).

u ((UUpp))
    Continue  execution, stop at the next port of tthhee ppaarreenntt  goal (thus
    skipping  this goal and all calls to  children of this goal).   This
    option is useful to stop tracing a failure driven loop.

w ((WWrriittee))
    Set   the  prolog-flag   debugger_print_options  to   [quoted(true)],
    bypassing portray/1, etc.

The   ideal  4   port  model   as  described   in   many  Prolog   books
[Clocksin & Melish, 1987] is not visible in many  Prolog implementations
because code optimisation  removes part of the choice- and  exit-points.
Backtrack  points   are  not   shown  if  either   the  goal   succeeded
deterministically or its alternatives were removed using the cut.   When
running in  debug mode (debug/0) choice  points are only destroyed  when
removed by  the cut.    In debug  mode, tail  recursion optimisation  is
switched off.

Reference information to  all predicates available for manipulating  the
debugger is in section 3.42.

During  program   development,  programs   are  normally  loaded   using
consult/1, or the list abbreviation.  It is  common practice to organise
a project  as a  collection of source-files  and a  _l_o_a_d_-_f_i_l_e, a  Prolog
file  containing only  use_module/[1,2]  or ensure_loaded/1  directives,
possibly  with a  definition  of the  _e_n_t_r_y_-_p_o_i_n_t  of the  program,  the
predicate that  is normally used  to start  the program.   This file  is
often  called load.pl.    If the  entry-point is  called _g_o,  a  typical
session starts as:

% pl
<banner>

1 ?- [load].
<compilation messages>

Yes
2 ?- go.
<program interaction>

When  using  Windows,  the  user  may  open  load.pl  from  the  Windows
explorer,  which will cause  plwin.exe to  be started  in the  directory
holding load.pl.  Prolog loads load.pl before entering the toplevel.

There are  various options if  you want to make  your program ready  for
real usage.   The best  choice depends on whether  the program is to  be
used only  on machines  holding the SWI-Prolog  development system,  the
size of the program and the operating system (Unix vs. Windows).

New in  version 4.0.5  is the possibility  to use  a Prolog source  file
directly  as a  Unix  script-file.   the  same  mechanism is  useful  to
specify additional parameters for running a Prolog file on Windows.

If the first  letter of a Prolog file  is #, the first line is  threated
as comment.  To  create a Prolog script, make the first line  start like
this:

    #!/path/to/pl <_o_p_t_i_o_n_s> -s

Prolog recognises this  starting sequence and causes the interpreter  to
receive the following argument-list:

    /path/to/pl <_o_p_t_i_o_n_s> -s <_s_c_r_i_p_t> -- <_S_c_r_i_p_t_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s>

Instead of  -s, the user may  use -f to stop  Prolog from looking for  a
personal initialisation file.

Here is a simple script doing expression evaluation:

#!/usr/bin/pl -q -t main -f

eval :-
        current_prolog_flag(argv, Argv),
        append(_, [--|Args], Argv),
        concat_atom(Args, ' ', SingleArg),
        term_to_atom(Term, SingleArg),
        Val is Term,
        format('~w~n', [Val]).

main :-
        catch(eval, E, (print_message(error, E), fail)),
        halt.
main :-
        halt(1).

And here are two example runs:

% eval 1+2
3
% eval foo
ERROR: Arithmetic: `foo/0' is not a function
%

TThhee  WWiinnddoowwss  vveerrssiioonn supports  the  #!  construct  too,   but  here  it
serves  a rather  different role.    The  Windows shell  already  allows
the  user to  start  Prolog source-files  directly through  the  Windows
file-type  association.   Windows  however makes  it rather  complicated
to  provide  additional parameters,  such  as  the  required  stack-size
for  an  individual Prolog  file.     The #!  line  provides  for  this,
providing a  more flexible approach then  changing the global  defaults.
The  following starts  Prolog  with unlimited  stack-size on  the  given
source-file:

#!/usr/bin/pl -L0 -T0 -G0 -s

....

Note the  use of  /usr/bin/pl, which  specifies the interpreter.    This
argument is ignored in the Windows version, but  required to ensure best
cross-platform compatibility.

With  the introduction  of _P_r_o_l_o_g_S_c_r_i_p_t  (see section  2.10.2.1),  using
shell-scripts  as explained  in this  section has  become redundant  for
most applications.

Especially  on  Unix systems  and  not-too-large  applications,  writing
a  shell-script  that  simply  loads  your  application  and  calls  the
entry-point is often a good choice.  A skeleton for  the script is given
below, followed by the Prolog code to obtain the program arguments.

#!/bin/sh

base=<absolute-path-to-source>
PL=pl

exec $PL -f none -g "load_files(['$base/load'],[silent(true)])" \
         -t go -- $*

go :-
        current_prolog_flag(argv, Arguments),
        append(_SytemArgs, [--|Args], Arguments), !,
        go(Args).

go(Args) :-
        ...

On Windows  systems, similar  behaviour can  be achieved  by creating  a
shortcut to Prolog, passing the proper options or writing a .bat file.

For larger programs,  as well as for  programs that are required run  on
systems that  do not have the  SWI-Prolog development system  installed,
creating a saved state is  the best solution.  A saved state  is created
using qsave_program/[1,2] or  using the linker plld(1).   A saved  state
is a file  containing machine-independent intermediate code in a  format
dedicated for fast loading.  Optionally, the  emulator may be integrated
in  the saved  state,  creating  a single-file,  but  machine-dependent,
executable.  This process is described in chapter 6.

This mechanism loads a series of Prolog source files  and then creates a
saved-state as qsave_program/2 does.  The command syntax is:

% pl [option ...] [-o output] -c file ...

The  _o_p_t_i_o_n_s argument  are  options to  qsave_program/2 written  in  the
format below.    The option-names  and their values  are described  with
qsave_program/2.

For example, to create a stan-alone executable that  starts by executing
main/0  and for  which the  source is  loaded through  load.pl, use  the
command

% pl --goal=main --stand_alone=true -o myprog -c load.pl

This performs exactly the same as executing

% pl
<banner>
?- [load].
?- qsave_program(myprog,
                 [ goal(main),
                   stand_alone(true)
                 ]).
?- halt.

The  predicates  current_prolog_flag/2 and  set_prolog_flag/2 allow  the
user  to examine  and modify  the execution  environment.   It  provides
access  to whether  optional  features are  available on  this  version,
operating  system,  foreign-code  environment,  command-line  arguments,
version,  as well  as runtime  flags to  control  the runtime  behaviour
of  certain  predicates  to  achieve  compatibility  with  other  Prolog
environments.

    The   predicate  current_prolog_flag/2  defines   an  interface   to
    installation   features:    options  compiled  in,  version,   home,
    etc.    With both arguments  unbound, it  will generate all  defined
    prolog-flags.    With  the  `Key' instantiated  it unify  the  value
    of  the  prolog-flag.    Features  come  in three  types:    boolean
    prolog-flags,  prolog-flags  with  an  atom value  and  prolog-flags
    with  an integer  value.    A boolean  prolog-flag is  true iff  the
    prolog-flag  is present aanndd the _V_a_l_u_e  is the atom true.   Currently
    defined keys:

    aarrcchh _(_a_t_o_m_)
         Identifier for the hardware and operating system  SWI-Prolog is
         running on.  Used  to determine the startup file as well  as to
         select foreign  files for  the right  architecture.   See  also
         section 5.4.

    vveerrssiioonn _(_i_n_t_e_g_e_r_)
         The version identifier is an integer with value:

                          10000_*Major+ 100_*Minor+_P_a_t_c_h

         Note that  in  releases upto  2.7.10 this  prolog-flag  yielded
         an  atom   holding  the  three   numbers  separated  by   dots.
         The  current representation  is  much easier  for  implementing
         version-conditional statements.

    hhoommee _(_a_t_o_m_)
         SWI-Prolog's  notion  of   the  home-directory.      SWI-Prolog
         uses  it's  home  directory   to  find  its  startup  file   as
         <_h_o_m_e>/startup/startup.<_a_r_c_h> and  to   find  its  library   as

         If true,  the system uses some  form of `sparse-memory  manage-
         ment' to realise the stacks.  If  false, malloc()/realloc() are
         used for  the stacks.   In earlier  days this had  consequenses
         for foreign code.   As  of version 2.5,  this is no longer  the
         case.

         Systems using  `sparse-memory management' are  a bit faster  as
         there is no  stack-shifter, and checking the stack-boundary  is
         often realised  by the hardware  using a  `guard-page'.   Also,
         memory  is actually  returned to  the  system after  a  garbage
         collection or call  to trim_stacks/0 (called by prolog/0  after
         finishing a user-query).

         If  true,  SWI-Prolog  is linked  with  the  readline  library.
         This is  done by  default if  you have  this library  installed
         on your  system.    It is  also true  for  the Win32  plwin.exe
         version of SWI-Prolog, which realises a subset  of the readline

         Maximum integer value represented as a `tagged' value.   Tagged
         integers require  4-bytes storage  and are  used for  indexing.
         Larger integers are represented as `indirect data'  and require
         16-bytes  on  the  stacks  (though  a  copy   requires  only  4

         C printf() format specification used by write/1  and friends to
         determine how floating point numbers are printed.   The default
         is %g.    The  specified value  is passed  to printf()  without
         further  checking.    For  example,  if you  want  more  digits
         printed, %.12g  will print all floats  using 12 digits  instead
         of the default 6.  See also format/[1,2],  write/1, print/1 and

         This flag  determines  how double-quotes  strings are  read  by

         If true  (default  is false),  Functor(arg) is  read  as if  it
         was written 'Functor'(arg).   Some applications use the  Prolog
         read/1  predicate for  reading  an application  defined  script
         language.   In these  cases, it is  often difficult to  explain
         none-Prolog  users  of  the  application  that   constants  and
         functions can only  start with a  lowercase letter.   Variables
         can be  turned into atoms  starting with  an uppercase atom  by
         calling read_term/2 using the option variable_names and binding
         the variables to their name.   Using this feature, F(x)  can be
         turned into valid syntax for such script languages.   Suggested
         by Robert van Engelen.  SWI-Prolog specific.

         Include some  weird ISO compatibility  that is incompatible  to

         effect:

           o is/2  and  evaluation  under flag/3  do  not  automatically
             convert  floats  to integers  if  the float  represents  an

         If true, compile in optimised mode.  The initial  value is true

         from expand_goal/2.

         Later versions might imply various other optimisations  such as
         integrating small  predicates into  their callers,  eliminating
         constant expressions and other predictable constructs.   Source
         code  optimisation is  never  applied  to predicates  that  are

SWI-Prolog provides a large number of hooks, mainly  to control handling
messages, debugging,  startup, shut-down, macro-expansion,  etc.   Below
is  a  summary  of  all  defined  hooks  with  an  indication  of  their
portability.

  o portray/1
    Hook into write_term/3 to alter the way terms are printed (ISO).

  o message_hook/3
    Hook  into  print_message/2 to  alter the  way system  messages  are
    printed (Quintus/SICStus).

  o library_directory/1
    Hook  into absolute_file_name/3 to define  new library  directories.
    (most Prolog system).

  o file_search_path/2
    Hook   into   absolute_file_name/3  to   define   new   search-paths
    (Quintus/SICStus).

  o term_expansion/2
    Hook  into  load_files/1  to  modify  read  terms  before  they  are
    compiled (macro-processing) (most Prolog system).

  o goal_expansion/2
    Same as term_expansion/2 for individual goals (SICStus).

  o prolog_edit:locate/3
    Hook into edit/1 to locate objects (SWI).

  o prolog_edit:edit_source/1
    Hook into edit/1 to call some internal editor (SWI).

  o prolog_edit:edit_command/2
    Hook into edit/1 to define the external editor to use (SWI).

  o prolog_list_goal/1
    Hook  into the tracer  to list the  code associated to a  particular
    goal (SWI).

  o prolog_trace_interception/4
    Hook into the tracer to handle trace-events (SWI).

  o prolog:debug_control_hook/1
    Hook  in spy/1, nospy/1, nospyall/0 and debugging/0 to  extend these
    control-predicates to higher-level libraries.

  o prolog:help_hook/1
    Hook in help/0, help/1 and apropos/1 to extend the help-system.

  o resource/3
    Defines a new resource (not really a hook, but similar) (SWI).

  o exception/3
    Old  attempt  to  a  generic  hook mechanism.     Handles  undefined
    predicates (SWI).

If ---at  runtime--- an undefined predicate  is trapped the system  will
first try to import the predicate from the module's default  module.  If
this fails the _a_u_t_o  _l_o_a_d_e_r is activated.  On first activation  an index
to all library files  in all library directories is loaded in  core (see
library_directory/1).  If the undefined predicate can be  located in the
one of the libraries  that library file is automatically loaded  and the
call to  the (previously undefined)  predicate is resumed.   By  default
this  mechanism loads  the  file silently.     The current_prolog_flag/2
verbose_autoload is provided  to get verbose loading.   The  prolog-flag
autoload can be used to enable/disable the entire auto load system.

The auto-loader only  works if the unknown  flag (see unknown/2) is  set
to trace (default).  A more appropriate interaction  with this flag will
be considered.

Autoloading  only handles  (library) source  files that  use the  module
mechanism  described  in  chapter  4.     The  files   are  loaded  with
use_module/2 and only the  trapped undefined predicate will be  imported
to the module  where the undefined predicate  was called.  Each  library
directory  must hold  a file  INDEX.pl  that contains  an index  to  all
library files  in the directory.    This file consists  of lines of  the
following format:

index(Name, Arity, Module, File).

The predicate make/0 scans the autoload libraries and  updates the index
if it  exists, is  writable and out-of-date.   It  is advised to  create
an empty  file called  INDEX.pl in  a library directory  meant for  auto
loading  before doing  anything  else.   This  index  file can  then  be
updated  by running  the prolog  make_library_index/1 (`%'  is the  Unix
prompt):

% mkdir ~/lib/prolog
% cd !$
% pl -g true -t 'make_library_index(.)'

If  there  are  more than  one  library  files  containing  the  desired
predicate the following search schema is followed:

 1. If  there is a  library file  that defines the  module in which  the
    undefined predicate is trapped, this file is used.

 2. Otherwise  library files  are considered  in the  order they  appear
    in  the  library_directory/1  predicate  and  within  the  directory
    alphabetically.

SWI-Prolog uses  standard `Edinburgh'  syntax.   A  description of  this
syntax can be found in the Prolog books referenced  in the introduction.
Below are some  non-standard or non-common constructs that are  accepted
by SWI-Prolog:

  o 0'<_c_h_a_r>
    This  construct is not accepted by all Prolog systems that  claim to
    have  Edinburgh compatible syntax.  It describes the ASCII  value of
    <_c_h_a_r>.   To  test whether C is  a lower case character  one can use
    between(0'a, 0'z, C).

  o /* .../* ...*/ ...*/
    The  /* ...*/  comment statement  can be  nested.    This is  useful
    if  some  code with  /* ...*/  comment statements  in it  should  be
    commented out.

Within quoted  atoms (using single quotes:   '<_a_t_o_m>'special  characters
are represented  using escape-sequences.    An escape  sequence is  lead
in  by the  backslash  (\) character.    The  list of  escape  sequences
is compatible  with the  ISO standard,  but contains  one extension  and
the interpretation of numerically specified characters  is slightly more
flexible to improve compatibility.

\a
    Alert character.  Normally the ASCII character 7 (beep).

\b
    Backspace character.

\c
    No  output.    All  input  characters  upto but  not  including  the
    first  non-layout  character  are skipped.     This allows  for  the
    specification of pretty-looking  long lines.  For compatibility with
    Quintus Prolog.  Nor supported by ISO. Example:

    format('This is a long line that would look better if it was \c
           split across multiple physical lines in the input')

\<RETURN>
    No  output.   Skips input till the  next non-layout character or  to
    the end of the next line.  Same intention as \c but ISO compatible.

\f
    Form-feed character.

\n
    Next-line character.

\r
    Carriage-return only (i.e. go back to the start of the line).

\t
    Horizontal tab-character.

\v
    Vertical tab-character (ASCII 11).

\x23
    Hexadecimal  specification of a character.   23 is just an  example.
    The  `x'  may be  followed by  a maximum  of  2 hexadecimal  digits.
    The  closing \  is optional.   The  code \xa\3  emits the  character
    10  (hexadecimal `a')  followed by  `3'.   The code  \x201 emits  32
    (hexadecimal  `20') followed by `1'.  According to ISO,  the closing
    \  is  obligatory and  the  number  of digits  is  unlimited.    The
    SWI-Prolog  definition allows for ISO compatible specification,  but
    is compatible with other implementations.

\40
    Octal   character  specification.     The  rules  and   remarks  for
    hexadecimal  specifications apply to  octal specifications too,  but
    the maximum allowed number of octal digits is 3.

\<_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r>
    Any  character immediately preceded  by a \  and not covered by  the
    above  escape sequences is copied verbatim.   Thus, '\\' is  an atom
    consisting  of a single \ and  '\'' and '''' both describe the  atom
    with a single '.

Character      escaping      is     only      available      if      the
current_prolog_flag(character_escapes, true) is active (default).    See
current_prolog_flag/2.   Character escapes conflict with writef/2  in two
ways:   \40  is interpreted  as decimal  40 by  writef/2, but  character
escapes  handling by  read has  already interpreted  as  32 (40  octal).
Also, \l is translated to  a single `l'.  It is adviced to use  the more
widely supported  format/[2,3] predicate instead.   If you insist  using
writef, either switch  character_escapes to  false, or use double \\,  as
in writef('\\l').

SWI-Prolog  implements  both  Edinburgh  and  ISO   representations  for
non-decimal numbers.   According to  Edinburgh syntax, such numbers  are
written as <_r_a_d_i_x>'<_n_u_m_b_e_r>, where <_r_a_d_i_x> is  a number between 2 and 36.
ISO defines binary,  octal and hexadecimal numbers using 0[bxo]<_n_u_m_b_e_r>.
For example:  A is 0b100 \/ 0xf00  is a valid expression.   Such numbers
are always unsigned.

SWI-Prolog has  a number of  memory areas which are  only enlarged to  a
certain limit.   The  default sizes for these  areas should suffice  for
most applications, but big  applications may require larger ones.   They
are modified  by command  line options.    The table  below shows  these
areas.   The first column  gives the option name  to modify the size  of
the area.  The option character is immediately followed  by a number and
optionally by  a k or  m.   With k or  no unit  indicator, the value  is
interpreted in Kbytes (1024 bytes), with m, the  value is interpreted in
Mbytes (10241* 024 bytes).

The local-,  global- and  trail-stack are  limited to 128  Mbytes on  32
bit processors,  or more in general to  2 to the power bits-per-long - 5
bytes.

The  PrologScript facility  described  in  section 2.10.2.1  provides  a
mechanism for  specifying options with  the load-file.   On Windows  the
default stack-sizes  are controlled  using the Windows  registry on  the
key  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SWI\Prolog using  the  names  localSize,
globalSize and trailSize.   The value is a DWORD expressing  the default
stack size  in Kbytes.   A  GUI for modifying  these values of  provided
using the XPCE package.

With  the heap,  we  refer  to the  memory  area  used by  malloc()  and
friends.  SWI-Prolog uses the area to store  atoms, functors, predicates
and their  clauses, records and  other dynamic data.   As of  SWI-Prolog
2.8.5, no limits are  imposed on the addresses returned by  malloc() and
friends.

On  some machines,  the  runtime stacks  described above  are  allocated
using `sparse allocation'.   Virtual space upto the limit is  claimed at
startup and  committed and released  while the  area grows and  shrinks.
On Win32  platform this  is realised using  VirtualAlloc() and  friends.
On Unix systems this is realised using mmap().

    the  number  of newlines  in  an  atom or  string  to 5  to  improve
    error  detection  and recovery.    This  can  be switched  off  with
    style_check/1.

The boot compiler  (see -b option) does  not support the module  system.
As large parts of  the system are written in Prolog itself we  need some
way to  avoid name clashes  with the  user's predicates, database  keys,
etc.   Like Edinburgh C-Prolog [Pereira, 1986] all predicates,  database
keys, etc. that should  be hidden from the user start with a  dollar ($)
sign (see style_check/1).

We have  tried to  keep the  predicate descriptions  clear and  concise.
First  the predicate  name is  printed  in bold  face, followed  by  the
arguments in  italics.   Arguments  are preceded by  a `+',  `-' or  `?'
sign.    `+'  indicates the  argument is  input  to the  predicate,  `-'
denotes output and  `?'  denotes `either  input or output'.   Constructs
like `op/3' refer to the predicate `op' with arity `3'.

In  traditional (Edinburgh-)  Prolog, characters  are represented  using
_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_-_c_o_d_e_s.   Character codes are  integer indices into a  specific
character set.   Traditionally  the character  set was 7-bits  US-ASCII.
Since a long while  8-bit character sets are allowed,  providing support
for  national character  sets,  of  which  iso-latin-1 (ISO  8859-1)  is
applicable  to many  western  languages.    Text-files are  supposed  to
represent a sequence of character-codes.

ISO Prolog introduces three types, two of which  are used for characters
and one for accessing binary streams (see open/4).  These types are:

  o _c_o_d_e
    A  _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_-_c_o_d_e is  an  integer representing  a single  character.
    As  files  may  use  multi-byte encoding  for  supporting  different
    character  sets (utf-8 encoding for example), reading a code  from a
    text-file is in general not the same as reading a byte.

  o _c_h_a_r
    Alternatively,  characters  may  be  represented  as  _o_n_e_-_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_-
    _a_t_o_m_s.    This is  a  very natural  representation, hiding  encoding
    problems  from  the  programmer as  well  as providing  much  easier
    debugging.

  o _b_y_t_e
    Bytes are used for accessing binary-streams.

The  current  version  of  SWI-Prolog  does  not   provide  support  for
multi-byte character encoding.  This implies for example  that it is not
capable of  breaking a  multi-byte encoded  atom into characters.    For
SWI-Prolog, bytes  and codes  are the same  and one-character-atoms  are
simple atoms containing one byte.

To  ease  the  pain  of  these  multiple  representations,  SWI-Prolog's
built-in  predicates dealing  with character-data  work  as flexible  as
possible:   they accept  data in  any of these  formats as  long as  the
interpretation  is unambiguous.     In addition,  for  output  arguments
that are  instantiated, the character  is extracted before  unification.
This implies  that the following two  calls are identical, both  testing
whether the next input characters is an a.

peek_code(Stream, a).
peek_code(Stream, 97).

These  multiple-representations  are  handled  by  a   large  number  of
built-in  predicates,   all   of  which   are  ISO-compatible.       For
converting  betweem  code and  character  there  is  char_code/2.     For
breaking  atoms  and  numbers  into  characters  are  are  atom_chars/2,
atom_codes/2,  number_codes/2 and  number_chars/2.    For  character  I/O
on  streams  there  is get_char/[1,2],  get_code/[1,2],  get_byte/[1,2],
peek_char/[1,2],   peek_code/[1,2],   peek_byte/[1,2],   put_code/[1,2],
put_char/[1,2]  and  put_byte/[1,2].     The  prolog-flag  double_quotes
(see current_prolog_flag/2) controls how  text between double-quotes  is
interpreted.

This section deals  with loading Prolog source-files.   A Prolog  source
file  is a  text-file (often  referred to  as  _A_S_C_I_I_-_f_i_l_e) containing  a
Prolog program  or part  thereof.   Prolog  source files  come in  three
flavours:

 AA ttrraaddiittiioonnaall   Prolog  source  file  contains  a  Prolog  clauses  and
    directives,  but no  _m_o_d_u_l_e_-_d_e_c_l_a_r_a_t_i_o_n.   They are normally  loaded
    using consult/1 or ensure_loaded/1.

 AA mmoodduullee   Prolog source file  starts with a module  declaration.   The
    subsequent Prolog code  is loaded into the specified module and only
    the _p_u_b_l_i_c predicates  are made available to the context loading the
    module.   Module  files are normally loaded  using use_module/[1,2].
    See chapter 4 for details.

 AA iinncclluuddee   Prolog source file is loaded using the  include/1 directive
    and normally contains only directives.

Prolog  source-files are  located  using  absolute_file_name/3 with  the
following options:

locate_prolog_file(Spec, Path) :-
        absolute_file_name(Spec,
                           [ file_type(prolog),
                             access(read)
                           ],
                           Path).

The file_type(_p_r_o_l_o_g) option is  used to determine the extension of  the
file using  prolog_file_type/2.    The default extension  is .pl.    _S_p_e_c
allows  for the  _p_a_t_h_-_a_l_i_a_s construct  defined  by absolute_file_name/3.
The  most  commonly  used  path-alias  is  library(_L_i_b_r_a_r_y_F_i_l_e).     The
example below loads the library file oset.pl  (containing predicates for
manipulating ordered sets).

:- use_module(library(oset)).

SWI-Prolog   recognises    grammar   rules    (DCG)   as   defined    in
[Clocksin & Melish, 1987].     The  user  may   define  additional  com-
pilation  of  the   source  file  by  defining  the  dynamic   predicate
term_expansion/2.    Transformations  by  this  predicate  overrule  the
systems  grammar  rule transformations.     It  is not  allowed  to  use
assert/1, retract/1 or any other  database predicate in term_expansion/2
other than for local computational purposes.

Directives  may be  placed  anywhere  in a  source  file,  invoking  any
predicate.    They are  executed when  encountered.    If the  directive
fails, a warning is printed.  Directives are specified  by :-/1 or ?-/1.
There is no difference between the two.

SWI-Prolog   does   not   have   a   separate   reconsult/1   predicate.
Reconsulting  is  implied automatically  by  the  fact that  a  file  is
consulted which is already loaded.

    The  predicate load_files/2 is the parent  of all the other  loading
    predicates.    It  currently supports  a subset  of  the options  of
    Quintus  load_files/2.   _F_i_l_e_s is  either specifies a  single, or  a
    list  of  source-files.    The specification  for a  source-file  is
    handled  absolute_file_name/2.  See this predicate  for the supported
    expansions.  _O_p_t_i_o_n_s is a list of options using the format

         _O_p_t_i_o_n_N_a_m_e(_O_p_t_i_o_n_V_a_l_u_e)

    The following options are currently supported:

    iiff((_C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n))
         Load the  file only  if the specified  condition is  satisfied.
         The value  true loads the  file unconditionally, changed  loads
         the file  if it  was not loaded  before, or  has been  modified
         since it was loaded the last time, not_loaded loads the file if
         it was not loaded before.

    mmuusstt__bbee__mmoodduullee((_B_o_o_l))
         If true,  raise an  error if  the file  is not  a module  file.
         Used by use_module/[1,2].

    iimmppoorrttss((_L_i_s_t_O_r_A_l_l))
         If  all and  the  file is  a  module file,  import  all  public
         predicates.  Otherwise import only the named predicates.   Each
         predicate is refered to  as <_n_a_m_e>/<_a_r_i_t_y>.  This  option has no
         effect if the file is not a module file.

    ssiilleenntt((_B_o_o_l))
         If  true, load  the  file  without printing  a  message.    The
         specified  value is  the  default for  all  files loaded  as  a
         result of loading the specified files.


ccoonnssuulltt((_+_F_i_l_e))
    Read  _F_i_l_e as a Prolog  source file.  _F_i_l_e  may be a list of  files,
    in  which case all members  are consulted in turn.   _F_i_l_e may  start
    with  the csh(1) special sequences ~,   <_u_s_e_r>and $<_v_a_r>.  _F_i_l_e  may
    also be library(Name),  in which case the libraries are searched for
    a  file with the specified  name.  See  also library_directory/1 and
    file_search_path/2.  consult/1  may be abbreviated by just  typing a
    number of file names in a list.  Examples:

        ?- consult(load).       % consult load or load.pl
        ?- [library(quintus)].  % load Quintus compatibility library

    Equivalent to load_files(Files, []).


eennssuurree__llooaaddeedd((_+_F_i_l_e))
    If the file  is not already loaded, this is equivalent to consult/1.
    Otherwise,   if  the  file  defines  a  module,  import  all  public
    predicates.    Finally,  if the  file is  already loaded,  is not  a
    module  file and the context module  is not the global user  module,
    ensure_loaded/1 will call consult/1.

    With the semantics, we  hope to get as closely possible to the clear
    semantics  without the presence  of a module  system.   Applications
    using modules should consider using use_module/[1,2].

    Equivalent to load_files(Files, [if(changed)]).

    Pretend  the  terms   in  _F_i_l_e  are  in  the  source-file  in  which
    :- include(File)  appears.  The include construct is  only honnoured
    if  it appears  as  a directive  in a  source-file.   Normally  _F_i_l_e
    contains a sequence of directives.

    Declare  that  this file/module  requires the  specified  predicates
    to  be defined ``with  their commonly accepted  definition''.   This
    predicate originates from  the Prolog portability layer for XPCE. It
    is  intended to  provide a  portable mechanism  for specifying  that
    this module requires the specified predicates.

    The implementation normally  first verifies whether the predicate is
    already defined.   If not, it will search the libraries and load the
    required library.

    SWI-Prolog, having autoloading,  does nnoott load the library.  Instead
    it  creates a procedure  header for the  predicate if this does  not
    exist.    This will flag  the predicate  as `undefined'.   See  also
    check/0 and autoload/0.


mmaakkee
    Consult  all source  files that  have been changed  since they  were
    consulted.   It checks _a_l_l  loaded source files:  files loaded  into
    a  compiled state  using pl -c ...  and files  loaded using  consult
    or  one of its  derivatives.  The  predicate make/0 is called  after
    edit/1,  automatically reloading all  modified files.   It the  user

    Dynamic  predicate used  to specify  library directories.    Default
    ./lib,  ~/lib/prolog and  the system's library  (in this order)  are
    defined.    The  user may  add library  directories using  assert/1,
    asserta/1 or remove system defaults using retract/1.

    Dynamic  predicate used to specify `path-aliases'.  This  feature is
    best described using an example.  Given the definition

    file_search_path(demo, '/usr/lib/prolog/demo').

    the  file specification demo(myfile)  will be expanded to  /usr/lib/
    prolog/demo/myfile.   The second  argument of file_search_path/2 may
    be another alias.

    Below  is the  initial definition  of the file  search path.    This
    path  implies  swi(<_P_a_t_h>)  refers  to  a  file  in  the  SWI-Prolog
    home   directory.     The  alias  foreign(<_P_a_t_h>) is   intended  for
    storing   shared  libraries  (.so  or   .DLL  files).     See   also
    load_foreign_library/[1,2].

    user:file_search_path(library, X) :-
            library_directory(X).
    user:file_search_path(swi, Home) :-

            atom_concat('lib/', Arch, ArchLib).
    user:file_search_path(foreign, swi(lib)).

    The  file_search_path/2expansion  is used by all loading  predicates
    as well as by absolute_file_name/[2,3].

    This  dynamic multifile predicate defined in module  user determines
    the  extensions considered by file_search_path/2.  _E_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n is  the
    filename  extension without the leading  dot, _T_y_p_e denotes the  type
    as  used by the file_type(_T_y_p_e) option of  file_search_path/2.   Here
    is the initial definition of prolog_file_type/2:

    user:prolog_file_type(pl,       prolog).
    user:prolog_file_type(Ext,      prolog) :-
            current_prolog_flag(associate, Ext),
            Ext \== pl.

    user:prolog_file_type(Ext,      executable) :-
            current_prolog_flag(shared_object_extension, Ext).

    Users  may  wish to  change  the extension  used for  Prolog  source
    files  to avoid  conflicts (for  example with  perl) as  well as  to
    be  compatible with  some specific  implementation.   The  preferred
    alternative extension is .pro.

    If  the last term has been read from a physical file (i.e.  not from
    the file user or  a string), unify _F_i_l_e with an absolute path to the
    file  and _L_i_n_e with the  line-number in the file.   New code  should
    use prolog_load_context/2.

    Dynamic  predicate, normally not defined.  When defined by  the user
    all  terms read during consulting that are given to  this predicate.
    If  the predicate succeeds Prolog will assert _T_e_r_m_2 in  the database
    rather  then the read term  (_T_e_r_m_1).  _T_e_r_m_2 may  be a term of a  the
    form  `?- _G_o_a_l' or `:- _G_o_a_l'.  _G_o_a_l is then treated  as a directive.
    If _T_e_r_m_2 is a  list all terms of the list are stored in the database
    or  called (for directives).   If  _T_e_r_m_2 is of  the form below,  the
    system  will assert _C_l_a_u_s_e and record the  indicated source-location
    with it.

    When compiling a  module (see chapter 4 and the directive module/2),
    expand_term/2  will first try  term_expansion/2 in the module  being
    compiled  to  allow  for  term-expansion rules  that  are  local  to
    a  module.     If  there  is  no  local  definition,  or  the  local
    definition  fails  to translate  the  term,  expand_term/2 will  try
    term_expansion/2  in module user.    For compatibility with  SICStus
    and  Quintus Prolog,  this feature  should not  be used.   See  also
    expand_term/2, goal_expansion/2 and expand_goal/2.

    This  predicate  is  normally  called by  the  compiler  to  perform
    preprocessing.   First it calls term_expansion/2.   If this predicate
    fails  it performs  a grammar-rule translation.    If this fails  it
    returns the first argument.

    Like   term_expansion/2,   goal_expansion/2  provides   for   macro-
    expansion  of Prolog  source-code.   Between  expand_term/2 and  the
    actual  compilation, the body of clauses analysed and the  goals are
    handed  to expand_goal/2, which  uses the goal_expansion/2 hook to do
    user-defined expansion.

    The  predicate goal_expansion/2 is first  called in the module  that
    is being compiled, and then on the user module.

    Only  goals  apearing   in  the  body  of  clauses  when  reading  a
    source-file  are expanded using mechanism,  and only if they  appear
    literally  in the clause, or  as an argument to the  meta-predicates
    not/1, call/1 or  forall/2.  A real predicate definition is required
    to deal with dynamically constructed calls.

    Initialisation  takes place after  reloading a .qlf (formerly  .wic)
    file  as well as after reloading a  saved-state.  The hooks  are run

    The  resulting atom  is called as  a Unix  command and the  standard

    one should define:

The features described in this section should be regarded aallpphhaa.

As of  version 2.0.0, SWI-Prolog  supports compilation of individual  or
multiple Prolog  sourcefiles into  `Quick Load  Files'.   A `Quick  Load
Files' (.qlf  file) stores  the contents  of the file  in a  precompiled
format.

These files load  considerably faster than sourcefiles and are  normally
more compact.    They are  machine independent  and may  thus be  loaded
on any  implementation of  SWI-Prolog.   Note however  that clauses  are
stored as virtual  machine instructions.   Changes to the compiler  will
generally make old compiled files unusable.

Quick Load Files  are created using qcompile/1.   They are loaded  using
consult/1  or one  of  the other  file-loading predicates  described  in
section 3.3.   If consult is given  the explicit .pl file, it will  load
the Prolog  source.  When  given the .qlf file,  it will load the  file.
When no extension is specified, it will load the  .qlf file when present
and the fileextpl file otherwise.


qqccoommppiillee((_+_F_i_l_e))
    Takes  a  single file  specification  like consult/1  (i.e.  accepts
    constructs like library(LibFile)  and creates a Quick Load File from
    _F_i_l_e.   The file-extension of this file  is .qlf.  The base  name of
    the Quick Load File is the same as the input file.

    If   the   file   contains   `:- consult(+File)'   or   `:- [+File]'
    statements,  the  referred files  are compiled  into  the same  .qlf
    file.    Other  directives  will  be stored  in  the .qlf  file  and
    executed in the same fashion as when loading the .pl file.

    For  term_expansion/2,  the same rules  as described in section  2.10
    apply.

    Source  references (source_file/2) in the  Quick Load File refer  to
    the Prolog source file from which the compiled code originates.

SWI-Prolog  offers an  extensible  interface which  allows the  user  to
edit objects  of the program:   predicates,  modules, files,  etc.   The
editor interface is  implemented by edit/1 and consists of  three parts:
_l_o_c_a_t_i_n_g, _s_e_l_e_c_t_i_n_g and _s_t_a_r_t_i_n_g _t_h_e _e_d_i_t_o_r.

Any of  these parts may  be extended or redefined  by adding clauses  to
various multi-file  (see multifile/1) predicates  defined in the  module
prolog_edit.

The built-in  edit specifications for edit/1  (see prolog_edit:locate/3)
are described below.

    a  list  of  _L_o_c_a_t_i_o_n_s.    If there  is  more than  one  `hit',  the
    user  is  allows to  select  from the  found  locations.    Finally,
    prolog_edit:edit_source/1 is  used  to invoke  the user's  preferred
    editor.

    Where  _S_p_e_c is  the  specification provided  through edit/1.    This
    multifile  predicate  is  used to  enumerate  locations at  with  an
    object satisfying the given  _S_p_e_c can be found.  _F_u_l_l_S_p_e_c is unified
    with  the complete specification for  the object.  This  distinction
    is  used to  allow for ambiguous  specifications.   For example,  if
    _S_p_e_c  is  an  atom,  which appears  as  the base-name  of  a  loaded
    file  and as  the name  of a predicate,  _F_u_l_l_S_p_e_c will  be bound  to
    file(_P_a_t_h) or _N_a_m_e/_A_r_i_t_y.

    _L_o_c_a_t_i_o_n  is a list of attributes  of the location.  Normally,  this
    list  will contain  the term file(_F_i_l_e)  and ---if available---  the
    term line(_L_i_n_e).

    Start  editor on _L_o_c_a_t_i_o_n.  See  prolog_edit:locate/3 for the format
    of  a location  term.   This  multi-file predicate  is normally  not
    defined.  If it succeeds, edit/1 assumes the editor is started.

    If  it fails,  edit/1 will invoke  an external editor.   The  editor
    to  be invoked  is determined from  the evironment variable  EDITOR,
    which  may  be set  from the  operating system  or  from the  Prolog
    initialisation file using setenv/2.   If no editor is defined, vi is
    the default in Unix systems, notepad on Windows and EPM on OS/2.

    The  predicate  prolog_edit:edit_command/2 defines  how  the  editor
    will be invoked.

    Determines  how _E_d_i_t_o_r is  to be invoked using  shell/1.  _E_d_i_t_o_r  is
    the  determined editor  (see edit_source/1), without  the full  path
    specification,  and without  possible (exe) extension.   _C_o_m_m_a_n_d  is
    an  atom describing  the command.   The  pattern %f  is replaced  by
    the  full file-name  of the  location, and  %d by  the line  number.
    If  the  editor can  deal with  starting at  a specified  line,  two
    clauses  should be provided,  one holding only  the %f pattern,  and
    one holding both patterns.

    The  default contains  definitions for vi,  emacs, emacsclient,  vim
    and notepad (latter without line-number version).

    Normally  not-defined  multifile  predicate.    This  predicate  may
    be  defined  to provide  loading hooks  for  user-extensions to  the

Comparison and  unification of arbitrary  terms.   Terms are ordered  in
the so called ``standard order''.  This order is defined as follows:

 1. _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s <_A_t_o_m_s <_S_t_r_i_n_g_s <_N_u_m_b_e_r_s <_T_e_r_m_s

 2. _O_l_d _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e <_N_e_w _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e

 3. _A_t_o_m_s are compared alphabetically.

 4. _S_t_r_i_n_g_s are compared alphabetically.

 5. _N_u_m_b_e_r_s  are compared  by value.   Integers  and floats are  treated
    identically.

 6. _C_o_m_p_o_u_n_d  terms are  first checked  on  their arity,  then on  their
    functor-name  (alphabetically)  and  finally  recursively  on  their
    arguments, leftmost argument first.

If  the  prolog_flag  (see  current_prolog_flag/2)  iso  is  defined,  all
floating point numbers precede all integers.


_+_T_e_r_m_1 == _+_T_e_r_m_2
    Succeeds  if _T_e_r_m_1  is  equivalent to  _T_e_r_m_2.   A  variable is  only
    identical to a sharing variable.


_+_T_e_r_m_1 \== _+_T_e_r_m_2
    Equivalent to \+Term1 == Term2.


_+_T_e_r_m_1 = _+_T_e_r_m_2
    Unify _T_e_r_m_1 with _T_e_r_m_2.  Succeeds if the unification succeeds.

    As  =/2, but  using _s_o_u_n_d_-_u_n_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n.    That is,  a variable  only
    unifies  to  a term  if  this term  does  not contain  the  variable
    itself.  To illustrate this, consider the two goals below:

    1 ?- A = f(A).

    A = f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(...))))))))))
    2 ?- unify_with_occurs_check(A, f(A)).

    No

    I.e.   the  first  creates  a  _c_y_c_l_i_c_-_t_e_r_m,  which  is   printed  as
    an   infinitly  nested  f/1  term  (see  the   max_depth   option  of
    write_term/2).  The second executes  logically sound unification and
    thus fails.

    Equivalent to \+Term1 = Term2.


_+_T_e_r_m_1 =@= _+_T_e_r_m_2
    Succeeds  if _T_e_r_m_1  is `structurally  equal' to _T_e_r_m_2.    Structural
    equivalence  is weaker  than equivalence (==/2),  but stronger  than
    unification  (=/2).  Two terms are structurally equal if  their tree
    representation  is identical  and they  have the  same `pattern'  of
    variables.  Examples:

               a  =@=  A       false
               A  =@=  B       true
          x(A,A)  =@=  x(B,C)  false
          x(A,A)  =@=  x(B,B)  true
          x(A,B)  =@=  x(C,D)  true

_+_T_e_r_m_1 @=< _+_T_e_r_m_2

    the standard order of terms.


_+_T_e_r_m_1 @> _+_T_e_r_m_2

_+_T_e_r_m_1 @>= _+_T_e_r_m_2

The predicates of  this section implement control structures.   Normally
these constructs  are translated  into virtual  machine instructions  by
the compiler.   It is still  necessary to implement these constructs  as
true predicates  to support meta-calls,  as demonstrated in the  example
below.  The  predicate finds all currently defined atoms of  1 character
long.   Note that  the cut has no  effect when called  via one of  these
predicates (see !/0).

one_character_atoms(As) :-
        findall(A, (current_atom(A), atom_length(A, 1)), As).


ffaaiill
    Always  fail.   The  predicate fail/0  is translated  into a  single
    virtual machine instruction.


ttrruuee
    Always  succeed.  The predicate  true/0 is translated into a  single
    virtual machine instruction.


rreeppeeaatt
    Always succeed, provide an infinite number of choice points.


!
    Cut.    Discard choice  points of  parent frame  and frames  created
    after the parent frame.   As of SWI-Prolog 3.3, the semantics of the
    cut are compliant with  the ISO standard.  This implies that the cut
    is  transparent to  ;/2, ->/2  and  *->/2.   Cuts  appearing in  the
    _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n  part of ->/2 and  *->/2 as well  as in \+/1 are local  to
    the condition.

             t1 :- (a, !, fail ; b).        % cuts a/0 and t1/0
             t2 :- (a -> b, !  ; c).        % cuts b/0 and t2/0
             t3 :- call((a, !, fail ; b)).  % cuts a/0
             t4 :- \+(a, !, fail ; b).      % cuts a/0


_+_G_o_a_l_1 , _+_G_o_a_l_2
    Conjunction.   Succeeds if both  `Goal1' and `Goal2' can be  proved.
    It  is defined as (this  definition does not lead  to a loop as  the
    second comma is handled by the compiler):

    Goal1, Goal2 :- Goal1, Goal2.


_+_G_o_a_l_1 ; _+_G_o_a_l_2
    The `or' predicate is defined as:

    Goal1 ; _Goal2 :- Goal1.
    _Goal1 ; Goal2 :- Goal2.


_+_G_o_a_l_1 | _+_G_o_a_l_2
    Equivalent  to ;/2.    Retained for compatibility  only.   New  code
    should use ;/2.


_+_C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n -> _+_A_c_t_i_o_n
    If-then  and  If-Then-Else.    The  ->/2  construct commits  to  the
    choices  made  at  its  left-hand  side,   destroying  choice-points
    created  inside the  clause (by  ;/2), or  by goals  called by  this
    clause.   Unlike !/0,  the choicepoint of  the predicate as a  whole
    (due  to multiple clauses)  is nnoott destroyed.   The combination  ;/2
    and ->/2  is defines as:

    If -> Then; _Else :- If, !, Then.
    If -> _Then; Else :- !, Else.
    If -> Then :- If, !, Then.

    Note   that  the   operator  precedence  relation   between  ;   and
    ->   ensure  If -> Then ; Else  is  actually  a  term  of  the  form
    ;(->(If, Then), Else).     The  first  two  clauses  belong  to  the
    definition of ;/2), while only the last defines ->/2 .


_+_C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n *-> _+_A_c_t_i_o_n _; _+_E_l_s_e
    This  construct implements  the so-called `soft-cut'.   The  control
    is  defined as follows:   If _C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n succeeds  at least once,  the
    semantics  is the same  as (_C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n, _A_c_t_i_o_n).   If _C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n  does
    not  succeed, the semantics is that of (_C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n, _E_l_s_e).   In other
    words,  If _C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n succeeds  at least once,  simply behave as  the
    conjunction of _C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n and _A_c_t_i_o_n, otherwise execute _E_l_s_e.


\+ _+_G_o_a_l
    Succeeds  if  `Goal'  cannot  be  proven (mnemonic:    +  refers  to
    _p_r_o_v_a_b_l_e  and  the  backslash  (\)  is  normally  used  to  indicate
    negation).

Meta call  predicates are used  to call terms  constructed at run  time.
The basic meta-call mechanism offered by SWI-Prolog is  to use variables
as a  subclause (which  should of  course be bound  to a  valid goal  at
runtime).   A  meta-call is  slower than a  normal call  as it  involves
actually searching the database at runtime for the  predicate, while for
normal calls this search is done at compile time.


ccaallll((_+_G_o_a_l))
    Invoke  _G_o_a_l as a  goal.   Note that clauses  may have variables  as
    subclauses,  which is identical to call/1, except when  the argument
    is bound to the cut.  See !/0.


ccaallll((_+_G_o_a_l_, _+_E_x_t_r_a_A_r_g_1_, _._._.))
    Append  _E_x_t_r_a_A_r_g_1_, _E_x_t_r_a_A_r_g_2_,  _._._.   to  the argument  list of  _G_o_a_l
    and  call the result.   For  example, call(plus(1), 2, X) will  call
    plus/3, binding _X to 3.

    The call/[2..]   construct is handled by the compiler, which implies
    that  redefinition as  a predicate has  no effect.   The  predicates
    call/[2-6]  are defined as true  predicates, so they can be  handled
    by interpreted code.


aappppllyy((_+_T_e_r_m_, _+_L_i_s_t))
    Append  the members of  _L_i_s_t to the arguments  of _T_e_r_m and call  the
    resulting  term.   For  example:   apply(plus(1), [2, X]) will  call
    plus(1, 2, X).   apply/2 is  incorporated in the virtual machine  of
    SWI-Prolog.   This implies that the overhead can be compared  to the
    overhead  of call/1.  New code should use call/[2..]   if the length
    of _L_i_s_t is  fixed, which is more widely supported and faster because
    there is no need to build and examine the argument list.


nnoott((_+_G_o_a_l))
    Succeeds  when _G_o_a_l cannot  be proven.   Retained for  compatibility
    only.  New code should use \+/1.


oonnccee((_+_G_o_a_l))
    Defined as:

    once(Goal) :-
            Goal, !.

    once/1  can  in  many  cases  be replaced  with  ->/2.     The  only
    difference  is how the  cut behaves  (see !/0).   The following  two
    clauses are identical:

    1) a :- once((b, c)), d.
    2) a :- b, c -> d.


iiggnnoorree((_+_G_o_a_l))
    Calls  _G_o_a_l  as once/1,  but succeeds,  regardless  of whether  _G_o_a_l
    succeeded or not.  Defined as:

    ignore(Goal) :-
            Goal, !.
    ignore(_).


ccaallll__wwiitthh__ddeepptthh__lliimmiitt((_+_G_o_a_l_, _+_L_i_m_i_t_, _-_R_e_s_u_l_t))
    If  _G_o_a_l can be proven  without recursion deeper than _L_i_m_i_t  levels,
    call_with_depth_limit/3 succeeds,  binding  _R_e_s_u_l_t  to  the  deepest
    recursion  level  used  during the  proof.    Otherwise,  _R_e_s_u_l_t  is
    unified  with depth_limit_exceeded  if the limit was exceeded  during
    the  proof,  or the  entire predicate  fails if  _G_o_a_l fails  without
    exceeding _L_i_m_i_t.

    The  depth-limit is guarded by the internal machinery.   This differ
    from  the  depth  computed  based  on a  theoretical  model.     For
    example,  true/0  is  translated  into an  inlined  virtual  machine
    instruction.   Also, repeat/0 is not implemented as below, but  as a
    non-deterministic foreign predicate.

    repeat.
    repeat :-
            repeat.

    As  a  result, call_with_depth_limit/3 may  still loop  inifitly  on
    programs  that should  theoretically finish  in finite time.    This
    problem  can be cured by  using Prolog equivalents to such  built-in
    predicates.

    This   predicate  may  be   used  for  theorem-provers  to   realise
    techniques  like _i_t_e_r_r_a_t_i_v_e  _d_e_e_p_e_n_i_n_g.   It  was implemented  after
    discussion with Steve Moyle smoyle@ermine.ox.ac.uk.

SWI-Prolog defines the predicates catch/3 and throw/1  for ISO compliant
raising  and catching  of exceptions.    In  the current  implementation
(4.0.6), most of  the built-in predicates generate exceptions,  but some
obscure predicates merely print a message, start the  debugger and fail,
which was the normal behaviour before the introduction of exceptions.


ccaattcchh((_:_G_o_a_l_, _+_C_a_t_c_h_e_r_, _:_R_e_c_o_v_e_r))
    Behaves  as call/1 if  no exception is  raised when executing  _G_o_a_l.
    If  a exception  is raised  using throw/1 while  _G_o_a_l executes,  and
    the  _G_o_a_l is the innermost goal  for which _C_a_t_c_h_e_r unifies with  the
    argument  of throw/1,  all choicepoints generated  by _G_o_a_l are  cut,
    the  system backtracks to the start of catch/3 while  preserving the
    thrown exception term and _R_e_c_o_v_e_r is called as in call/1.

    The  overhead of calling a  goal through catch/3 is very  comparable
    to  call/1.  Recovery from  an exception is much slower,  especially
    if the exception-term is large due to the copying thereof.


tthhrrooww((_+_E_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n))
    Raise  an exception.   The  system looks  for the innermost  catch/3
    ancestor  for which _E_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n unifies  with the _C_a_t_c_h_e_r argument  of
    the catch/3 call.  See catch/3 for details.

    ISO  demands throw/1 to make a copy of _E_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n, walk up  the stack
    to a catch/3 call,  backtrack and try to unify the copy of _E_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n
    with  _C_a_t_c_h_e_r.   SWI-Prolog delays  making a  copy of _E_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n  and
    backtracking  until it actually found a matching catch/3 goal.   The
    advantage  is that we can start  the debugger at the first  possible
    location  while preserving the entire exception context if  there is
    no  matching  catch/3 goal.    This aproach  can  lead to  different
    behaviour  if _G_o_a_l and _C_a_t_c_h_e_r of catch/3 call share variables.   We
    assume this to be  highly unlikely and could not think of a scenario
    where this is useful.

    If  an exception is raised in a callback from C (see chapter  5) and

    exception context can be retrieved using PL_exception().

Before  the introduction  of exceptions  in SWI-Prolog  a runtime  error
was handled  by printing  an error  message, after  which the  predicate
failed.   If  the prolog_flag (see current_prolog_flag/2) debug_on_error
was in effect  (default), the tracer was  switched on.  The  combination
of the  error message and trace  information is generally sufficient  to
locate the error.

With exception handling,  things are different.   A programmer may  wish
to trap an  exception using catch/3 to avoid  it reaching the user.   If
the  exception is  not handled  by user-code,  the interactive  toplevel
will trap it to prevent termination.

If  we  do  not  take  special  precautions,   the  context  information
associated with  an unexpected exception (i.e.  a programming error)  is
lost.  Therefore,  if an exception is raised, which is not  caught using
catch/3 and the toplevel is running, the error will  be printed, and the
system will enter trace mode.

If the system  is in an non-interactive  callback from foreign code  and
there is no catch/3  active in the current context, it  cannot determine
whether or  not the  exception will  be caught by  the external  routine
calling Prolog.    It will  then base  its behaviour on  the prolog_flag
debug_on_error:

  o _c_u_r_r_e_n_t___p_r_o_l_o_g___f_l_a_g_(_d_e_b_u_g___o_n___e_r_r_o_r_, _f_a_l_s_e_)
    The  exception does  not trap the  debugger and  is returned to  the
    foreign  routine  calling Prolog,  where it  can  be accessed  using
    PL_exception().  This is the default.

  o _c_u_r_r_e_n_t___p_r_o_l_o_g___f_l_a_g_(_d_e_b_u_g___o_n___e_r_r_o_r_, _t_r_u_e_)
    If the exception is  not caught by Prolog in the current context, it
    will trap the tracer to help analysing the context of the error.

While looking for the  context in which an exception takes place,  it is
adviced to switch on debug mode using the predicate debug/0.

Builtin  predicates  generates exceptions  using  a  term  error(_F_o_r_m_a_l_,
_C_o_n_t_e_x_t).    The  first argument  is  the  `formal' description  of  the
error,  specifying the class  and generic  defined context  information.
When applicable,  the ISO  error-term definition  is used.   The  second
part  describes some  additional context  to help  the programmer  while
debugging.    In its  most  generic form  this  is a  term of  the  form
context(_N_a_m_e_/_A_r_i_t_y_,  _M_e_s_s_a_g_e), where _N_a_m_e/_A_r_i_t_y  describes the  built-in
predicate  that raised  the error,  and _M_e_s_s_a_g_e  provides an  additional
description of the error.  Any part of this structure  may be a variable
if no information was present.

The predicate print_message/2 may be  used to print a message term  in a
human readable  format.   The other predicates  from this section  allow
the user  to refine  and extend  the message system.    The most  common
usage of  print_message/2 is to  print error  messages from  exceptions.
The code below  prints errors encountered during the execution  of _G_o_a_l,
without  further propagating  the  exception  and without  starting  the
debugger.

        ...,
        catch(Goal, E,
              ( print_message(error, E),
                fail
              )),
        ...

Another common  use is to  defined message_hook/3 for printing  messages
that are normally _s_i_l_e_n_t, suppressing messages,  redirecting messages or
make something happen in addition to printing the message.


pprriinntt__mmeessssaaggee((_+_K_i_n_d_, _+_T_e_r_m))
    The  predicate print_message/2 is  used to  print messages,  notably
    from  exceptions  in  a human-readable  format.    _K_i_n_d  is  one  of
    informational,   banner,  warning,  error,   help  or  silent.     A
    human-readable message is printed to the stream user_error.

    If  the prolog flag  (see current_prolog_flag/2) verbose is  silent,
    messages  with _K_i_n_d informational, or banner are treated  as silent.
    See -q.

    This  predicate first translates  the _T_e_r_m into  a list of  `message
    lines'  (see print_message_lines/3for  details).  Next it  will call
    the hook  message_hook/3to allow the  user intercepting the message.
    If  message_hook/3 fails it  will print the  message unless _K_i_n_d  is
    silent.

    The  print_message/2  predicate  and  its  rules  are  in  the  file
    <_p_l_h_o_m_e>/boot/messages.pl,   which  may   be   inspected  for   more
    information on the error messages and related error terms.

    Print a  message (see print_message/2) that has  been translated to a
    list of message elements.  The elements of this list are:

         If this  appears as the  last element,  _S_t_r_e_a_m is flushed  (see
         flush_output/1) and no final newline is generated.

    at_same_line
         If this  appears as  first element,  no prefix  is printed  for
         the first line  and the line-position is  not forced to 0  (see
         format/1, ~N).

    <_F_o_r_m_a_t>

As  of  version  3.1.0,   SWI-Prolog  is  capable  to   handle  software
interrupts  (signals) in  Prolog as  well as  in foreign  (C) code  (see
section 5.6.12).

Signals are used to handle internal errors (execution  of a non-existing
CPU  intruction,  arithmetic  domain  errors,   illegal  memory  access,
resource  overflow,   etc.),  as   well  as  for  dealing   asynchronous
inter-process communication.

Signals  are  defined  by  the Posix  standard  and  part  of  all  Unix
machines.    The  MS-Windows  Win32  provides  a subset  of  the  signal
handling  routines, lacking  the vital  funtionality to  raise a  signal
in  another   thread  for   achieving  asynchronous  inter-process   (or
inter-thread) communication (Unix kill() function).


oonn__ssiiggnnaall((_+_S_i_g_n_a_l_, _-_O_l_d_, _:_N_e_w))
    Determines  the reaction on  _S_i_g_n_a_l.   _O_l_d is  unified with the  old
    behaviour, while the behaviour  is switched to _N_e_w.  As with similar
    environment-control  predicates,  the  current  value  is  retrieved
    using on_signal(Signal, Current, Current).

    The  action  description  is  an  atom  denoting  the  name  of  the
    predicate  that  will be  called  if _S_i_g_n_a_l  arrives.    on_signal/3
    is  a meta predicate,  which implies that <_M_o_d_u_l_e>:<_N_a_m_e>  refers the
    <_N_a_m_e>/1 in the module <_M_o_d_u_l_e>.

    Two  predicate-names have  special meaning.    throw implies  Prolog
    will  map  the  signal  onto  a Prolog  exception  as  described  in
    section  3.9.   default resets  the handler  to the settings  active
    before SWI-Prolog manipulated the handler.

    Signals  bound   to  a  foreign  function  through  PL_signal()  are
    reported using the term $foreign_function(_A_d_d_r_e_s_s).

    After  receiving a signal mapped to throw, the exception  raised has
    the structure

         error(signal(<_S_i_g_N_a_m_e>, <_S_i_g_N_u_m>), <_C_o_n_t_e_x_t>)

    One possible usage of  this is, for example, to limit the time spent
    on  proving a goal.  This  requires a little C-code for  setting the
    alarm timer (see chapter 5):

    #include <SWI-Prolog.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    foreign_t
    pl_alarm(term_t time)
    { double t;

      if ( PL_get_float(time, &t) )
      { alarm((long)(t+0.5));

        PL_succeed;
      }

      PL_fail;
    }

    install_t
    install()
    { PL_register_foreign("alarm", 1, pl_alarm, 0);
    }

    Next, we can define the following Prolog code:

    :- load_foreign_library(alarm).

    :- on_signal(alrm, throw).

    :- module_transparent
            call_with_time_limit/2.

    call_with_time_limit(Goal, MaxTime) :-
            alarm(MaxTime),
            catch(Goal, error(signal(alrm, _), _), fail), !,
            alarm(0).
    call_with_time_limit(_, _) :-
            alarm(0),
            fail.

    The  signal names are  defined by the  C-Posix standards as  symbols
    of  the form  SIG_<_S_I_G_N_A_M_E>.    The Prolog name  for a  signal is the
    lowercase  version of <_S_I_G_N_A_M_E>.  The predicate current_signal/3 may
    be used to map between names and signals.

    Initially,  some  signals  are  mapped to  throw,  while  all  other
    signals  are default.    The following signals  throw an  exception:
    ill, fpe, segv, pipe, alrm, bus, xcpu, xfsz and vtalrm.

    Enumerate  the  currently defined  signal  handling.   _N_a_m_e  is  the
    signal  name,  _I_d is  the numerical  identifier and  _H_a_n_d_l_e_r is  the
    currently defined handler (see on_signal/3).

Before  deciding  to deal  with  signals  in  your  application,  please
consider the following:

  o _P_o_r_t_i_b_i_l_i_t_y
    On MS-Windows, the  signal interface is severely limited.  Different
    Unix  brands support  different sets  of signals,  and the  relation
    between signal name and number may vary.

  o _S_a_f_e_t_y
    Signal   handling   is   not   completely  safe   in   the   current
    implementation,  especially  if throw  is used  in combination  with
    external  foreign  code.    The  system  will use  the  C  longjmp()
    construct  to  direct control  to the  innermost PL_next_solution(),
    thus  forcing an external procedure to be abandoned at  an arbitrary
    moment.   Most likely not all SWI-Prologs own foreign code  is (yet)
    safe too.

  o _G_a_r_b_a_g_e _C_o_l_l_e_c_t_i_o_n
    The  garbage  collector  will block  all  signals that  are  handled
    by  Prolog.    While handling  a  signal, the  garbage-collector  is
    disabled.

  o _T_i_m_e _o_f _d_e_l_i_v_e_r_y
    Normally  delivery  is immediate  (or as  defined  by the  operating
    system  used).   Signals are blocked  when the garbage collector  is
    active,  and internally delayed if they occur within in  a `critical
    section'.  The critical sections are generally very short.

The  block/3 predicate  and  friends  have been  introduced  before  ISO
compatible  catch/3  exception  handling  for  compatibility  with  some
Prolog implementation.    The only  feature not covered  by catch/3  and
throw/1 is the posibility  to execute global cuts.  New code  should use
catch/3 and throw/1 to deal with exceptions.

    Execute  _G_o_a_l in a _b_l_o_c_k.   _L_a_b_e_l is the name  of the block.   _L_a_b_e_l
    is  normally an  atom, but  the system imposes  no type  constraints
    and  may even be a variable.   _E_x_i_t_V_a_l_u_e is normally unified  to the
    second argument of an exit/2 call invoked by _G_o_a_l.


eexxiitt((_+_L_a_b_e_l_, _+_V_a_l_u_e))

    The  block's _E_x_i_t_V_a_l_u_e is unified with  _V_a_l_u_e.  If this  unification

Grammar rules  form a comfortable interface  to _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_-_l_i_s_t_s.   They
are designed  both to support  writing parsers  that build a  parse-tree
from a list as for  generating a flat list from a term.   Unfortunately,
Definite  Clause  Grammar (DCG)  handling  is  not part  of  the  Prolog
standard.   Most Prolog  engines implement DCG,  but the details  differ
slightly.

Grammar rules  look like  ordinary clauses  using -->/2  for  separating
the head  and body rather then  :-/2.   Expanding grammar rules is  done
by expand_term/2, which  adds two additional  argument to each term  for
representing the difference list.   We will illustrate the  behaviour by
defining a rule-set for parsing an integer.

integer(I) -->
        digit(D0),
        digits(D),
        { number_chars(I, [D0|D])
        }.

digits([D|T]) -->
        digit(D), !,
        digits(T).
digits([]) -->
        [].

digit(D) -->
        [D],
        { code_type(D, digit)
        }.

The  body of  a grammar  rule  can contain  three  types of  terms.    A
compound  term interpreted  as a  reference  to a  grammar-rule.    Code
between {...}  is interpreted  as a  reference to  ordinary Prolog  code
and finally,  a list  is interpreted  as a  sequence of literals.    The
Prolog control-constructs (\+/1,  ->/2, ;//2, ,/2  and !/0) can be  used
in grammar rules.

Grammar rule-sets are  called using the builtin predicates phrase/2  and
phrase/3:


pphhrraassee((_+_R_u_l_e_S_e_t_, _+_I_n_p_u_t_L_i_s_t))
    Equivalent to phrase(RuleSet, InputList, []).

    Activate  the rule-set with given name.  `InputList' is the  list of
    tokens to parse,  `Rest' is unified with the remaining tokens if the
    sentence is parsed  correctly.  The example below calls the rule-set
    `integer' defined above.

    ?- phrase(integer(X), "42 times", Rest).

    X = 42
    Rest = [32, 116, 105, 109, 101, 115]


33..1133 DDaattaabbaassee

SWI-Prolog offers  three different database mechanisms.   The first  one
is  the common  assert/retract  mechanism  for manipulating  the  clause
database.    As facts  and clauses  asserted using  assert/1  or one  of
its  derivatives become  part of  the program  these predicates  compile
the term  given to them.    retract/1 and retractall/1  have to unify  a
term and  therefore have to  decompile the program.   For these  reasons
the assert/retract  mechanism is  expensive.   On the  other hand,  once
compiled, queries to the database are faster than  querying the recorded
database discussed below.  See also dynamic/1.

The second way of  storing arbitrary terms in the database is  using the
``recorded database''.   In  this database terms  are associated with  a
_k_e_y.  A key can be an atom, integer or term.   In the last case only the
functor and  arity determine the  key.   Each key has  a chain of  terms
associated with it.   New terms  can be added either  at the head or  at
the tail  of this  chain.   This mechanism  is considerably faster  than
the assert/retract mechanism as terms are not compiled,  but just copied
into the heap.

The third mechanism is a special purpose one.   It associates an integer
or atom with  a key, which is  an atom, integer or  term.  Each key  can
only have  one atom or integer  associated with it.   It is faster  than
the mechanisms  described above, but  can only be  used to store  simple
status information like counters, etc.

    Removes  all clauses of a  predicate with functor _F_u_n_c_t_o_r and  arity
    _A_r_i_t_y  from  the  database.    All  predicate  attributes  (dynamic,
    multifile,  index, etc.)  are  reset to their defaults.   Abolishing
    an  imported predicate only removes  the import link; the  predicate
    will keep its old definition in its definition module.

    According  to the  ISO standard,  abolish/1 can only  be applied  to
    dynamic  procedures.    This is  odd, as  for  dealing with  dynamic
    procedures  there  is  already  retract/1 and  retractall/1.     The
    abolish/1  predicate has been introduced in DEC-10  Prolog precisely
    for dealing with  static procedures.  In SWI-Prolog, abolish/1 works
    on static procedures, unless the prolog flag iso is set to true.

    It  is adviced  to use  retractall/1 for  erasing all  clauses of  a
    dynamic predicate.

    This  directive  may be  used  both in  module  user and  in  normal
    modules to redefine  any system predicate.  If the system definition
    is  redefined in  module user,  the  new definition  is the  default
    definition  for  all sub-modules.    Otherwise  the redefinition  is
    local  to the module.   The system definition remains in the  module
    system.

    Redefining   system   predicate   facilitates  the   definition   of
    compatibility packages.  Use in other context is discouraged.

Traditionally,  Prolog systems  used  the _i_m_m_e_d_i_a_t_e  _u_p_d_a_t_e _v_i_e_w:    new
clauses  became   visible  to   predicates  backtracking  over   dynamic
predicates   immediately   and  retracted   clauses   became   invisible
immediately.

Starting  with SWI-Prolog  3.3.0  we  adhere the  _l_o_g_i_c_a_l  _u_p_d_a_t_e  _v_i_e_w,
where backtrackable predicates that enter the definition  of a predicate
will not  see any changes  (either caused by  assert/1 or retract/1)  to
the  predicate.    This view  is the  ISO  standard, the  most  commonly
used and  the most  `safe'.   Logical  updates are  realised by  keeping
reference-counts on  predicates and  _g_e_n_e_r_a_t_i_o_n information on  clauses.
Each change  to the database  causes an increment  of the generation  of
the database.  Each  goal is tagged with the generation in which  it was
started.  Each  clause is flagged with the generation it was  created as
well as  the generation  it was  erased.   Only  clauses with  `created'
...`erased' interval  that encloses the generation  of the current  goal
are considered visible.

By  default,   SWI-Prolog,  as   most  other  implementations,   indexes
predicates  on their  first argument.    SWI-Prolog  allows indexing  on
other and multiple arguments using the declaration index/1.

For advanced database indexing, it defines hash_term/2:


hhaasshh__tteerrmm((_+_T_e_r_m_, _-_H_a_s_h_K_e_y))
    If  _T_e_r_m is a ground term (see ground/1), _H_a_s_h_K_e_y is unified  with a
    positive integer value that  may be used as a hash-key to the value.
    If  _T_e_r_m is not ground, the predicate succeeds  immediately, leaving
    _H_a_s_h_K_e_y an unbound variable.

    This  predicate  may be  used to  build hash-tables  as  well as  to
    exploit argument-indexing to find complex terms more quickly.

    The  hash-key does not rely on temporary information  like addresses
    of  atoms and may be assumed constant over different  invocations of
    SWI-Prolog.

This  section  describes  directives  which  manipulate   attributes  of
predicate  definitions.     The  functors  dynamic/1,   multifile/1  and
discontiguous/1  are  operators  of  priority  1150  (see  op/3),  which
implies  the  list of  predicates  they  involve  can just  be  a  comma
separated list:

:- dynamic
        foo/0,
        baz/2.

On SWI-Prolog all  these directives are just  predicates.  This  implies
they can also  be called by a program.   Do not rely on this  feature if
you want to maintain portability to other Prolog implementations.

    Informs  the interpreter  that  the definition  of the  predicate(s)
    may  change  during  execution (using  assert/1  and/or  retract/1).
    Currently  dynamic/1  only stops  the interpreter  from  complaining
    about  undefined  predicates  (see  unknown/2).     Future  releases
    might  prohibit  assert/1  and retract/1  for  not-dynamic  declared
    procedures.

    Informs  the system that the  specified predicate(s) may be  defined
    over  more than one  file.  This  stops consult/1 from redefining  a
    predicate when a new definition is found.

    Informs  the system that the  clauses of the specified  predicate(s)
    might not be together in the source file.  See also style_check/1.


iinnddeexx((_+_H_e_a_d))
    Index  the clauses  of the predicate  with the  same name and  arity
    as  _H_e_a_d  on the  specified arguments.    _H_e_a_d is  a  term of  which
    all  arguments  are  either  `1' (denoting  `index  this  argument')
    or  `0'  (denoting `do  not index  this argument').    Indexing  has
    no  implications  for the  semantics of  a  predicate, only  on  its
    performance.    If  indexing is  enabled on  a  predicate a  special
    purpose  algorithm  is used  to select  candidate  clauses based  on
    the  actual arguments of  the goal.   This algorithm checks  whether
    indexed  arguments might  unify in  the clause  head.   Only  atoms,
    integers  and compound  terms are  considered.   Compound terms  are
    indexed  on the combination  of their name and  arity.  Indexing  is
    very useful for predicates with many clauses representing facts.

    Due to the  representation technique used at most 4 arguments can be
    indexed.  All  indexed arguments should be in the first 32 arguments
    of  the predicate.    If  more than  4 arguments  are specified  for
    indexing only the first  4 will be accepted.  Arguments above 32 are
    ignored for indexing.

    By  default  all predicates  with <_a_r_i_t_y> 1  are indexed  on their
    first  argument.  It is possible to redefine indexing  on predicates
    that  already have clauses attached to  them.  This will initiate  a
    scan through the  predicates clause list to update the index summary
    information stored with each clause.

    If---for  example---one wants to  represents sub-types using a  fact
    list  `sub_type(Sub, Super)' that should be  used both to  determine
    sub- and super types one should declare sub_type/2 as follows:

    :- index(sub_type(1, 1)).

    sub_type(horse, animal).
    ...
    ...

    Otherwise  the name  and arity  of _P_r_e_d  are used  to determine  the
    predicate.    If _I_n_d_e_x is  provided _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e  will be unified  with
    the  clause  reference.   If  _I_n_d_e_x  is unbound,  backtracking  will
    yield  both the  indices and the  references of  all clauses of  the
    predicate.  The following example finds the 2nd clause of member/2:

    ?- nth_clause(member(_,_), 2, Ref), clause(Head, Body, Ref).

    Ref = 160088
    Head = system : member(G575, [G578|G579])
    Body = member(G575, G579)

SWI-Prolog provides two  different packages for input  and output.   One
confirms  to  the  Edinburgh  standard.    This  package  has  a  notion
of  `current-input' and  `current-output'.    The  reading  and  writing
predicates implicitly refer  to these streams.   In the second  package,
streams are  opened explicitly and  the resulting handle  is used as  an
argument to the reading  and writing predicate to specify the  source or
destination.   Both packages are fully  integrated; the user may  switch
freely between them.

The  package  for  implicit input  and  output  destination  is  upwards
compatible to DEC-10 and  C-Prolog.  The reading and  writing predicates
refer to resp.   the current input- and output stream.   Initially these
streams are  connected to the  terminal.  The  current output stream  is
changed using tell/1 or  append/1.  The current input stream  is changed
using see/1.  The streams current value can  be obtained using telling/1
for output- and seeing/1  for input streams.  The table below  shows the
valid stream specifications.  The reserved names user_input, user_output
and user_error are for neat integration with the explicit streams.

           ___________________________________________________
           | user        |This  reserved name  refers to  the|
           |             |terminal                           |
           | user_input  I|nput from the terminal            |

           | user_output O|utput to the terminal             |

           |_pipe(<_A_t_o_m>)N|ame_of_a_Unix_command_____________|_

Source and  destination are  either a file,  one of  the reserved  words
above, or a term  `pipe(_C_o_m_m_a_n_d)'.  In the predicate  descriptions below
we will call the source/destination argument `_S_r_c_D_e_s_t'.   Below are some
examples of source/destination specifications.

       ?- see(data).         % Start reading from file `data'.
       ?- tell(user_error).  % Start writing on the error stream.

       ?- tell(pipe(lpr)).   % Start writing to the printer.

Another example  of using  the pipe/1 construct  is shown  below.   Note
that  the  pipe/1  construct  is  not  part  of  Prolog's  standard  I/O
repertoire.

getwd(Wd) :-
        seeing(Old), see(pipe(pwd)),
        collect_wd(String),
        seen, see(Old),
        atom_codes(Wd, String).

collect_wd([C|R]) :-
        get0(C), C \== -1, !,
        collect_wd(R).
collect_wd([]).


sseeee((_+_S_r_c_D_e_s_t))
    Make  _S_r_c_D_e_s_t the  current input  stream.   If  _S_r_c_D_e_s_t was  already
    opened  for  reading  with see/1  and  has  not been  closed  since,
    reading  will be resumed.  Otherwise _S_r_c_D_e_s_t will be opened  and the
    file pointer is positioned at the start of the file.


tteellll((_+_S_r_c_D_e_s_t))
    Make  _S_r_c_D_e_s_t the  current output stream.    If _S_r_c_D_e_s_t was  already
    opened  for writing with tell/1 or append/1 and has not  been closed
    since,  writing will  be resumed.    Otherwise the  file is  created
    or---when existing---truncated.  See also append/1.


aappppeenndd((_+_F_i_l_e))
    Similar  to tell/1,  but positions the  file pointer  at the end  of
    _F_i_l_e  rather than truncating an existing  file.  The pipe  construct
    is not accepted by this predicate.


sseeeeiinngg((_?_S_r_c_D_e_s_t))

The predicates  below are  part of the  Quintus compatible  stream-based
I/O package.   In this package streams are explicitly created  using the
predicate open/3.   The resulting stream identifier is then passed  as a
parameter to  the reading and writing  predicates to specify the  source
or destination of the data.

    ISO  compliant predicate  to open  a stream.   _S_r_c_D_e_s  is either  an
    atom,  specifying  a  Unix file,  or  a term  `pipe(Command)',  just
    like  see/1 and  tell/1.   _M_o_d_e  is one  of read,  write, append  or
    update.   Mode  append opens the file  for writing, positioning  the
    file-pointer  at the end.   Mode update opens the file for  writing,
    positioning  the file-pointer at the  beginning of the file  without
    truncating the  file.  See also stream_position/3.   _S_t_r_e_a_m is either
    a variable, in which  case it is bound to an integer identifying the
    stream,  or an  atom, in  which case  this atom will  be the  stream
    identifier.  The _O_p_t_i_o_n_s list can contain the following options:

    ttyyppee((_T_y_p_e))
         Using type text (default), Prolog will write a  text-file in an
         operating-system compatible way.   Using type binary the  bytes
         will be read  or written without any  translation.  Note  there
         is no difference between the two on Unix systems.

    aalliiaass((_A_t_o_m))
         Gives the  stream a name.   Below  is an example.   Be  careful
         with  this  option  as stream-names  are  global.     See  also
         set_stream/2.

         ?- open(data, read, Fd, [alias(input)]).

                 ...,
                 read(input, Term),
                 ...

    eeooff__aaccttiioonn((_A_c_t_i_o_n))
         Defines  what  happens  if the  end  of  the  input  stream  is
         reached.   Action eof_code makes get0/1  and friends return  -1
         and read/1 and friends return the atom end_of_file.  Repetitive
         reading keeps yielding the  same result.  Action error  is like
         eof_code, but repetitive  reading will  raise an error.    With
         action reset,  Prolog will  examine the file  again and  return
         more data if the file has grown.

    bbuuffffeerr((_B_u_f_f_e_r_i_n_g))
         Defines output  buffering.    The atom  full (default)  defines
         full buffering, line buffering  by line, and false implies  the
         stream is  fully unbuffered.   Smaller  buffering is useful  if
         another process or the user is waiting for the output  as it is
         being produced.   See also flush_output/[0,1].  This option  is
         not an ISO option.

    cclloossee__oonn__aabboorrtt((_B_o_o_l))
         If  true (default),  the  stream is  closed  on an  abort  (see
         abort/0).   If  false, the  stream is  not closed.    If it  is
         an output  stream,  it will  be flushed  however.   Useful  for
         logfiles and if  the stream is  associated to a process  (using
         the pipe/1 construct).

    The  option reposition is not supported in SWI-Prolog.   All streams
    connected to a file may be repositioned.

ooppeenn__nnuullll__ssttrreeaamm((_?_S_t_r_e_a_m))
    Open  a stream that produces no output.  All counting  functions are
    enabled  on such a stream.   An attempt  to read from a  null-stream
    will  immediately signal  end-of-file.   Similar to Unix  /dev/null.
    _S_t_r_e_a_m can be an atom, giving the null-stream an alias name.


cclloossee((_+_S_t_r_e_a_m))
    Close the specified stream.   If _S_t_r_e_a_m is not open an error message
    is  displayed.  If the closed stream is the current input  or output
    stream the terminal is made the current input or output.

    this  way, any resource error  (such as write-errors while  flushing
    the output buffer) are ignored.

         If _S_t_r_e_a_m is  associated to a file,  unify _A_t_o_m to the name  of
         this file.

    mmooddee((_I_O_M_o_d_e))
         Unify  _I_O_M_o_d_e to  the  mode given  to  open/4 for  opening  the
         stream.   Values are:  read,  write, append and the  SWI-Prolog

         If _A_t_o_m is bound,  test of the stream has the  specified alias.
         Otherwise unify _A_t_o_m with the first alias of the stream.

    ppoossiittiioonn((_T_e_r_m))
         Unify  _T_e_r_m  with the  current  stream-position.     A  stream-

    rreeppoossiittiioonn((_B_o_o_l))
         Unify _B_o_o_l  with _t_r_u_e  if  the position  of the  stream can  be
         set (see seek/4).   It  is assumed the  position can be set  if
         the stream  has a  _s_e_e_k_-_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n and is  not based  on a  POSIX

    The  predicate current_stream/3 is  used to access  the status of  a
    stream as well as  to generate all open streams.  _O_b_j_e_c_t is the name
    of the file opened  if the stream refers to an open file, an integer

    unified with the new offset, relative to the start of the stream.

    If  the seek  modifies the  current  location, the  line number  and
    character position in the line are set to 0.

    If  the stream cannot be repostioned, a reposition error  is raised.

    Wait  for input on  one of the  streams in _L_i_s_t_O_f_S_t_r_e_a_m_s and  return
    a  list  of  streams  on  which input  is  available  in  _R_e_a_d_y_L_i_s_t.
    wait_for_input/3 waits  for at most  _T_i_m_e_O_u_t seconds.   _T_i_m_e_o_u_t  may
    be  specified as a floating point  number to specify fractions of  a
    second.   If _T_i_m_e_o_u_t equals  0, wait_for_input/3waits  indefinitely.
    This  predicate can be used  to implement timeout while reading  and
    to  handle  input from  multiple  sources.   The  following  example
    will  wait for input from the  user and an explicitly opened  second
    terminal.  On return, _I_n_p_u_t_s may hold user or _P_4 or both.

    ?- open('/dev/ttyp4', read, P4),
       wait_for_input([user, P4], Inputs, 0).

    This  predicate  relies  on  the select()  call  on  most  operating
    systems.     On  Unix  this  call  is  implemented  for  any  stream
    referring  to a  file-handle,  which implies  all OS-based  streams:
    sockets,  terminals, pipes,  etc.  On  non-Unix systems select()  is
    generally  only  implemented for  socket-based streams.    See  also
    library(socket) from the clib package.

    Unify  _C_o_u_n_t with the position on the current line.  Note  that this
    assumes  the position is 0 after the  open.  Tabs are assumed  to be
    defined on each  8-th character and backspaces are assumed to reduce
    the count by one, provided it is positive.

This section  describes the basic term  reading and writing  predicates.
The  predicates  term_to_atom/2,  atom_to_term/3  and  sformat/3  provide
means  for translating  atoms and  strings  to terms.    The  predicates
format/[1,2] and writef/2 provide formatted output.

There are  two ways  to manipulate  the output  format.   The  predicate
print/[1,2]  may  be  programmed  using  portray/1.      The  format  of
floating point  numbers may  be manipulated  using the  prolog_flag  (see
current_prolog_flag/2) float_format.

Reading  is  sensitive   to  the  prolog_flag  character_escapes,   which
controls  the interpretation  of the  \ character  in  quoted atoms  and
strings.


wwrriittee__tteerrmm((_+_T_e_r_m_, _+_O_p_t_i_o_n_s))
    The  predicate  write_term/2  is  the generic  form  of  all  Prolog
    term-write predicates.  Valid options are:

    qquuootteedd((true _o_r false))
         If true, atoms and  functors that needs quotes will  be quoted.
         The default is false.

    cchhaarraacctteerr__eessccaappeess((true _o_r false))
         If true,  and  quoted(_t_r_u_e) is  active,  special characters  in
         quoted atoms and  strings are emitted as ISO  escape-sequences.
         Default is taken from the reference module (see below).

    iiggnnoorree__ooppss((true _o_r false))
         If true, the generic term-representation (<_f_u_n_c_t_o_r>(<_a_r_g_s> ...))
         will be  used for  all terms,  Otherwise (default),  operators,
         list-notation and  {}/1  will be  written using  their  special
         syntax.

    mmoodduullee((_M_o_d_u_l_e))
         Define the reference module  (default user).  This  defines the
         default value for  the character_escapes option as well as  the
         operator definitions to use.  See also op/3.

    nnuummbbeerrvvaarrss((true _o_r false))
         If true, terms  of the format $VAR(N), where  <_N> is a positive
         integer, will be  written as a variable  name.  The default  is
         false.

    ppoorrttrraayy((true _o_r false))
         If true, the  hook portray/1 is  called before printing a  term
         that is not  a variable.   If portray/1  succeeds, the term  is
         considered printed.  See  also print/1.  The default  is false.
         This option is an extension to the ISO write_term options.

    mmaaxx__ddeepptthh((_I_n_t_e_g_e_r))
         If the term is nested deeper than _I_n_t_e_g_e_r,  print the remainder
         as eclipse (...).  A 0 (zero) value (default)  imposes no depth
         limit.  This option  also delimits the number of printed  for a
         list.  Example:

         ?- write_term(a(s(s(s(s(0)))), [a,b,c,d,e,f]), [max_depth(3)]).
         a(s(s(...)), [a, b|...])

         Yes

         Used   by  the   toplevel   and   debugger  to   limit   screen
         output.   See also the  prolog-flags toplevel_print_options  and
         debugger_print_options.

    current output.


wwrriittee__ccaannoonniiccaall((_+_T_e_r_m))
    Write  _T_e_r_m on  the current output  stream using standard  parenthe-
    sised prefix notation  (i.e. ignoring operator declarations).  Atoms
    that need quotes are  quoted.  Terms written with this predicate can
    always  be read back,  regardless of current operator  declarations.
    Equivalent to write_term/2 using the options ignore_ops and quoted.

    Write  _T_e_r_m  to the  current output,  using  brackets and  operators
    where  appropriate.     See  current_prolog_flag/2  for  controlling
    floating point output format.

    Write  _T_e_r_m  to the  current output,  using  brackets and  operators
    where  appropriate.    Atoms that  need quotes  are quoted.    Terms
    written  with this predicate can  be read back with read/1  provided
    the currently active operator declarations are identical.


wwrriitteeqq((_+_S_t_r_e_a_m_, _+_T_e_r_m))
    Write _T_e_r_m to _S_t_r_e_a_m, inserting quotes.


pprriinntt((_+_T_e_r_m))
    Prints  _T_e_r_m on the  current output stream  similar to write/1,  but
    for each (sub)term  of _T_e_r_m first the dynamic predicate portray/1 is

ppoorrttrraayy((_+_T_e_r_m))
    A dynamic predicate, which  can be defined by the user to change the
    behaviour  of print/1 on (sub)terms.   For each subterm  encountered
    that is not  a variable print/1 first calls portray/1 using the term
    as  argument.    For lists  only the  list as  a whole  is given  to
    portray/1.   If portray succeeds  print/1 assumes the term has  been
    written.

    Read  the next Prolog term from  the current input stream and  unify
    it  with _T_e_r_m.  On a syntax error read/1 displays an  error message,
    attempts  to  skip  the erroneous  term  and  fails.    On  reaching

             A list.  _E_l_m_s describes the  positions of the elements.  If
             the list specifies the tail as |<_T_a_i_l_T_e_r_m>, _T_a_i_l is unified

    Similar  to read_term/2 using the option variable_names, but  allows
    for history  substitutions.  read_history/6is used  by the top level
    to  read the user's actions.   _S_h_o_w is  the command the user  should
    type  to show  the saved  events.   _H_e_l_p is  the command  to get  an
    overview  of the capabilities.   _S_p_e_c_i_a_l is a list of commands  that
    are  not saved in the  history.  _P_r_o_m_p_t  is the first prompt  given.
    Continuation  prompts for  more  lines are  determined by  prompt/2.
    A  %w  in the  prompt  is substituted  by  the event  number.    See
    section 2.7 for available substitutions.

    SWI-Prolog calls read_history/6 as follows:

    read_history(h, '!h', [trace], '%w ?- ', Goal, Bindings)


pprroommpptt((_-_O_l_d_, _+_N_e_w))
    Set  prompt associated  with read/1  and its  derivatives.   _O_l_d  is
    first  unified with the current prompt.  On success the  prompt will
    be  set to _N_e_w if  this is an atom.   Otherwise an error message  is
    displayed.   A prompt  is printed if one  of the read predicates  is
    called  and the cursor is  at the left margin.   It is also  printed
    whenever  a newline is given and  the term has not been  terminated.
    Prompts are only printed when the current input stream is _u_s_e_r.


pprroommpptt11((_+_P_r_o_m_p_t))

    If  _T_e_r_m is a variable  it is unified with  a new term holding  only
    variables.    functor/3 silently  fails on  instantiation faults  If
    _T_e_r_m  is an atom or  number, _F_u_n_c_t_o_r will  be unified with _T_e_r_m  and

aarrgg((_?_A_r_g_, _?_T_e_r_m_, _?_V_a_l_u_e))
    _T_e_r_m  should be instantiated  to a term,  _A_r_g to an integer  between
    1  and  the  arity of  _T_e_r_m.    _V_a_l_u_e  is  unified with  the  _A_r_g-th
    argument  of _T_e_r_m.   _A_r_g may also  be unbound.   In this case  _V_a_l_u_e
    will  be unified  with the  successive arguments of  the term.    On
    successful  unification, _A_r_g  is unified  with the argument  number.
    Backtracking  yields alternative  solutions.    The predicate  arg/3
    fails  silently if  _A_r_g= 0 or _A_r_g > _a_r_i_t_y and raises  the exception

    Extra-logical  predicate.     Assigns the  _A_r_g-th  argument  of  the
    compound  term _T_e_r_m with the given _V_a_l_u_e.  The assignment  is undone
    if  backtracking brings the  state back into  a position before  the

_?_T_e_r_m =.. _?_L_i_s_t
    _L_i_s_t  is a list which head is the functor of _T_e_r_m and  the remaining
    arguments are the arguments  of the term.  Each of the arguments may
    be  a variable,  but not  both.   This predicate  is called  `Univ'.
    Examples:

    Unify  the free variables of _T_e_r_m  with a term constructed from  the
    atom  _F_u_n_c_t_o_r with one argument.  The argument is the number  of the

    A = this_is_a_variable(0)

These predicates  convert between  Prolog constants and  lists of  ASCII
values.   The predicates atom_codes/2, number_codes/2 and name/2  behave
the same  when converting  from a constant  to a  list of ASCII  values.
When  converting the  other way  around, atom_codes/2  will generate  an
atom,  number_codes/2 will generate  a  number or  exception and  name/2
will return a number if possible and an atom otherwise.

The  ISO  standard  defines atom_chars/2  to  describe  the  `broken-up'
atom  as a  list of  one-character atoms  instead of  a  list of  codes.
Upto  version 3.2.x,  SWI-Prolog's atom_chars/2 behaved,  compatible  to
Quintus and  SICStus Prolog,  like atom_codes.    As of 3.3.x  SWI-Prolog
atom_codes/2 and atom_chars/2are compliant to the ISO standard.

To  ease  the pain  of  all  variations in  the  Prolog  community,  all
SWI-Prolog predicates  behave as  flexible as  possible.   This  implies
the  `list-side' accepts  either  a code-list  or  a char-list  and  the
`atom-side' accept all atomic types (atom, number and string).

    If  _A_t_o_m has no  valid syntax,  a syntax_error exception is  raised.

    Use  _A_t_o_m as  input to  read_term/2 using the  option variable_names

    _A_t_o_m_3  forms the concatenation of _A_t_o_m_1 and _A_t_o_m_2.  At least  two of
    the  arguments must be instantiated  to atoms, integers or  floating
    point  numbers.    For  ISO  compliance,  the  instantiation-pattern
    -, -, +  is allowed  too, non-deterministically  splitting the  3-th
    argument  into two parts  (as append/3  does for lists).   See  also

    of  _L_i_s_t.    If _L_i_s_t  has exactly  2 elements  it  is equivalent  to

    Creates  an  atom just  like  concat_atom/2, but  inserts  _S_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r

    _S_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r and _A_t_o_m:

    Succeeds  if  _A_t_o_m starts  with the  characters from  _P_r_e_f_i_x.    Its
    behaviour  is equivalent  to ?- concat(Prefix, _, Atom), but  avoids
    the construction of an atom for the `remainder'.

    ISO  predicate  for breaking  atoms.    It maintains  the  following
    relation:  _S_u_b is  a sub-atom of _A_t_o_m that starts at _B_e_f_o_r_e, has _L_e_n
    characters and _A_t_o_m contains _A_f_t_e_r characters after the match.

    ?- sub_atom(abc, 1, 1, A, S).

    A = 1, S = b

    The  implementation  minimalises  non-determinism  and  creation  of
    atoms.    This  is a  very flexible  predicate that  can do  search,
    prefix- and suffix-matching, etc.

SWI-Prolog   offers  two   comprehensive  predicates   for   classifying
characters and character-codes.  These predicates are  defined as built-
in predicates  to exploit the  C-character classification's handling  of
_l_o_c_a_l_e (handling of  local character-sets).  These predicates  are fast,
logical and deterministic if applicable.

In   addition,   there   is   the   library   library(ctype)   providing
compatibility to  some other  Prolog systems.   The  predicates of  this

SWI-Prolog  supports the  data type  _s_t_r_i_n_g.   Strings  are  a time  and
space efficient mechanism  to handle text text  in Prolog.  Strings  are
stores as a byte array on the global (term) stack  and thus destroyed on
backtracking and reclaimed by the garbage collector.

Strings were  added to  SWI-Prolog based on  an early  draft of the  ISO
standard, offerring  a mechanism to  represent temporary character  data
efficiently.    As  SWI-Prolog  strings can  handle  0-bytes,  they  are
frequently used through  the foreign language interface (section 5)  for
storing arbitrary byte-sequences.

Starting with version  3.3, SWI-Prolog offers garbage collection  on the
atom-space as well as  representing 0-bytes in atoms.   Although strings
and  atoms still  have  different  features,  new code  should  consider
using  atoms to  avoid too  many  representations for  text as  well  as
for  compatibility to  other Prolog  systems.   Below  are  some of  the
differences:

  o _c_r_e_a_t_i_o_n
    Creating  strings  is fast,  as the  data is  simply  copied to  the
    global  stack.   Atoms are  unique and  therefore more expensive  in
    terms  of memory  and time to  create.   On the other  hand, if  the
    same  text has  to be  represented  multiple times,  atoms are  more
    efficient.

  o _d_e_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n
    Backtracking destroys strings at  no cost.  They are cheap to handle
    by  the garbage  collector, but  it should be  noted that  extensive
    use  of strings will cause many  garbage collections.  Atom  garbage
    collection is generally faster.

See also the prolog-flag double_quotes.

    Logical  conversion between  a string  and an atom.    At least  one
    of  the two arguments  must be instantiated.   _A_t_o_m  can also be  an
    integer or floating point number.


ssttrriinngg__ttoo__lliisstt((_?_S_t_r_i_n_g_, _?_L_i_s_t))
    Logical conversion between  a string and a list of ASCII characters.
    At least one of the two arguments must be instantiated.


ssttrriinngg__lleennggtthh((_+_S_t_r_i_n_g_, _-_L_e_n_g_t_h))
    Unify  _L_e_n_g_t_h  with  the number  of  characters  in _S_t_r_i_n_g.     This
    predicate  is  functionally  equivalent  to atom_length/2  and  also
    accepts atoms, integers and floats as its first argument.

    Similar  to atom_concat/3,  but the unbound argument will  be unified
    with  a string object rather  than an atom.   Also, if both  _S_t_r_i_n_g_1
    and  _S_t_r_i_n_g_2 are  unbound and _S_t_r_i_n_g_3  is bound to  text, it  breaks
    _S_t_r_i_n_g_3,  unifying the start with  _S_t_r_i_n_g_1 and the end with  _S_t_r_i_n_g_2
    as  append does  with lists.   Note  that this  is not  particularly
    fast  on long  strings as  for each redo  the system  has to  create
    two  entirely new strings, while the list equivalent only  creates a
    single new list-cell and moves some pointers around.

    _S_u_b  is a substring of _S_t_r_i_n_g starting at _S_t_a_r_t, with  length _L_e_n_g_t_h

33..2244 OOppeerraattoorrss

Operators  are  defined  to  improve  the  readibility  of  source-code.
For  example, without  operators, to  write  2*3+4*5 one  would have  to
write +(*(2,3),*(4,5)).    In Prolog,  a number of  operators have  been
predefined.   All operators, except for  the comma (,) can be  redefined
by the user.

Some care  has to  be taken  before defining  new operators.    Defining
too many  operators might  make your  source `natural'  looking, but  at
the same  time lead  to hard to  understand the  limits of your  syntax.
To ease  the pain, as  of SWI-Prolog 3.3.0,  operators are local to  the
module  in which  they are  defined.   The  module-table  of the  module
user acts as  default table for all modules.   This global table can  be
modified explictly from inside a module:

:- module(prove,
          [ prove/1
          ]).

:- op(900, xfx, user:(=>)).

Unlike  what many  users  think,  operators  and quoted  atoms  have  no
relation:   defining a atom  as an operator  does nnoott influence  parsing
characters into atoms and  quoting an atom does nnoott stop it  from acting
as an operator.   To stop an atom  acting as an operator, enclose  it in
braces like this:  (myop).


oopp((_+_P_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_c_e_, _+_T_y_p_e_, _:_N_a_m_e))
    Declare  _N_a_m_e  to  be  an  operator of  type  _T_y_p_e  with  precedence
    _P_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_c_e.    _N_a_m_e  can also  be a  list of  names,  in which  case
    all  elements of the  list are declared  to be identical  operators.
    _P_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_c_e  is an integer between 0 and 1200.  Precedence  0 removes
    the  declaration.   _T_y_p_e is one  of:   xf, yf, xfx,  xfy, yfx,  yfy,
    fy  or fx.   The `f'  indicates the position  of the functor,  while
    x  and y  indicate the position  of the  arguments.   `y' should  be
    interpreted  as ``on this position  a term with precedence lower  or
    equal to the precedence  of the functor should occur''.  For `x' the
    precedence  of the argument must be strictly lower.   The precedence
    of  a term is  0, unless  its principal functor  is an operator,  in
    which  case the precedence  is the precedence of  this operator.   A
    term enclosed in brackets (...) has precedence 0.

    The  predefined operators are  shown in  table 3.1.   Note that  all
    operators can be redefined by the user.

Arithmetic can be  divided into some special purpose integer  predicates
and  a series  of  general predicates  for  floating point  and  integer
arithmetic as  appropriate.  The  integer predicates are as  ``logical''
as possible.  Their usage is recommended  whenever applicable, resulting
in faster and more ``logical'' programs.

The  general arithmetic  predicates  are  optionally compiled  now  (see
set_prolog_flag/2  and  the   -O  command  line   option).      Compiled
arithmetic reduces global  stack requirements and improves  performance.
Unfortunately compiled arithmetic cannot  be traced, which is why  it is
optional.

The  general  arithmetic   predicates  all  handle  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_s.      An
expression is either a simple number or a _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n.   The arguments of a
function are expressions.  The functions are described in section 3.27.

    _L_o_w  and _H_i_g_h  are integers, _H_i_g_h  _L_o_w.   If _V_a_l_u_e  is an integer,
    _L_o_w  _V_a_l_u_e _H_i_g_h.   When _V_a_l_u_e  is a  variable it  is successively
    bound to all integers between _L_o_w and _H_i_g_h.


ssuucccc((_?_I_n_t_1_, _?_I_n_t_2))
    Succeeds  if _I_n_t_2= _I_n_t_1+ 1.  At least one of  the arguments must be
    instantiated to an integer.


pplluuss((_?_I_n_t_1_, _?_I_n_t_2_, _?_I_n_t_3))
    Succeeds if  _I_n_t_3= _I_n_t_1+_I_n_t_2.   At least two of the three arguments
    must be instantiated to integers.


_+_E_x_p_r_1 > _+_E_x_p_r_2
    Succeeds  when expression  _E_x_p_r_1 evaluates to  a larger number  than
    _E_x_p_r_2.


_+_E_x_p_r_1 < _+_E_x_p_r_2
    Succeeds  when expression _E_x_p_r_1 evaluates  to a smaller number  than
    _E_x_p_r_2.


_+_E_x_p_r_1 =< _+_E_x_p_r_2
    Succeeds  when  expression _E_x_p_r_1  evaluates to  a  smaller or  equal
    number to _E_x_p_r_2.


_+_E_x_p_r_1 >= _+_E_x_p_r_2
    Succeeds  when  expression  _E_x_p_r_1 evaluates  to  a larger  or  equal
    number to _E_x_p_r_2.


_+_E_x_p_r_1 =\= _+_E_x_p_r_2
    Succeeds  when expression _E_x_p_r_1 evaluates  to a number non-equal  to
    _E_x_p_r_2.


_+_E_x_p_r_1 =:= _+_E_x_p_r_2
    Succeeds  when  expression  _E_x_p_r_1 evaluates  to  a number  equal  to
    _E_x_p_r_2.


_-_N_u_m_b_e_r iiss _+_E_x_p_r
    Succeeds  when  _N_u_m_b_e_r   has  successfully  been  unified  with  the
    number  _E_x_p_r  evaluates to.    If  _E_x_p_r evaluates  to a  float  that
    can  be represented  using  an integer  (i.e. the  value is  integer
    and  within the  range  that can  be described  by Prolog's  integer
    representation),  _E_x_p_r is unified with the integer value.

    Note  that normally, is/2  will be used  with unbound left  operand.
    If equality is to be tested, =:=/2 should be used.  For example:

         ?- 1.0 is sin(pi/2).         Fails!.   sin(pi/2) evaluates
                                      to   1.0,   but   is/2   will
                                      represent this as the integer
                                      1,  after  which  unify  will
                                      fail.

         ?- 1.0 is float(sin(pi/2)).  Succeeds,   as   the  float/1
                                      function forces the result to
                                      be float.
         ?- 1.0 =:= sin(pi/2).        Succeeds as expected.

Arithmetic functions  are terms  which are evaluated  by the  arithmetic
predicates described  above.   SWI-Prolog tries  to hide the  difference
between  integer  arithmetic  and floating  point  arithmetic  from  the
Prolog  user.   Arithmetic  is done  as integer  arithmetic  as long  as
possible  and converted  to floating  point arithmetic  whenever one  of
the arguments  or the combination of  them requires it.   If a  function
returns  a floating  point  value which  is  whole it  is  automatically
transformed into  an integer.   There  are three  types of arguments  to
functions:

        _E_x_p_r     Arbitrary   expression,   returning  either   a
                 floating point value or an integer.
        _I_n_t_E_x_p_r  Arbitrary expression that should  evaluate into
                 an integer.
        _I_n_t      An integer.

In  case integer  addition, subtraction  and  multiplication would  lead
to  an integer  overflow  the operands  are automatically  converted  to
floating point  numbers.   The floating  point functions (sin/1,  exp/1,
etc.)     form  a  direct  interface  to  the  corresponding  C  library
functions used  to compile SWI-Prolog.   Please refer  to the C  library
documentation for details on precision, error handling, etc.

Prolog predicates  can be given  the role of arithmetic  function.   The
last  argument is  used  to  return the  result,  the  arguments  before
the last  are the  inputs.   Arithmetic  functions are  added using  the
predicate arithmetic_function/1, which takes  the head as its  argument.
Arithmetic  functions  are module  sensitive,  that  is  they  are  only
visible from the module  in which the function is defined  and declared.
Global  arithmetic  functions  should be  defined  and  registered  from
module user.   Global definitions can  be overruled locally in  modules.
The builtin functions described above can be redefined as well.

    Register  a Prolog  predicate as an  arithmetic function (see  is/2,
    >/2 , etc.).   The Prolog  predicate should  have one more  argument
    than  specified by _H_e_a_d, which it either a term _N_a_m_e_/_A_r_i_t_y,  an atom
    or  a complex term.   This last argument  is an unbound variable  at
    call  time and  should  be instantiated  to an  integer or  floating
    point  number.    The other  arguments  are the  parameters.    This
    predicate  is  module  sensitive  and will  declare  the  arithmetic
    function  only for the context  module, unless declared from  module
    user.  Example:

    1 ?- [user].
    :- arithmetic_function(mean/2).

    mean(A, B, C) :-
            C is (A+B)/2.
    user compiled, 0.07 sec, 440 bytes.

    Yes
    2 ?- A is mean(4, 5).

    of  _L_i_s_t, sorted to the standard  order of terms (see section  3.6).
    Duplicates  are removed.  Implemented by translating the  input list
    into  a temporary  array,  calling the  C-library function  qsort(3)
    using  PL_compare() for  comparing  the  elements, after  which  the

    carried  along with  the key.   keysort/2  sorts _L_i_s_t like  msort/2,
    but  only compares  the keys.    Can be used  to sort  terms not  on
    standard  order, but  on any criterion  that can  be expressed on  a
    multi-dimensional scale.   Sorting on more than one criterion can be
    done  using terms as keys,  putting the first criterion as  argument
    1,  the second as argument 2,  etc.  The order of  multiple elements
    that have the same _K_e_y is not changed.

    calling  _P_r_e_d(-_D_e_l_t_a, +_E_1, +_E_2).   This call  must unify _D_e_l_t_a  with

    besides  the one  sharing  with _V_a_r  bagof will  backtrack over  the
    alternatives  of  these  free  variables,   unifying  _B_a_g  with  the
    corresponding  alternatives of _V_a_r.   The construct +Var^Goal  tells
    bagof  not to  bind  _V_a_r in  _G_o_a_l.   bagof/3  fails if  _G_o_a_l has  no

The  current  version   of  SWI-Prolog  provides  two  formatted   write
predicates.    The  first  is writef/[1,2],  which  is  compatible  with
Edinburgh C-Prolog.   The  second is  format/[1,2], which is  compatible
with Quintus  Prolog.   We hope  the Prolog  community will once  define
a  standard formatted  write predicate.    If you  want performance  use
format/[1,2] as this predicate is defined in  C. Otherwise compatibility
reasons might tell you which predicate to use.

    Defined as `format(Format) :- format(Format, []).'


ffoorrmmaatt((_+_F_o_r_m_a_t_, _+_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s))
    _F_o_r_m_a_t   is  an   atom,   list  of   ASCII  values,   or  a   Prolog
    string.   _A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s  provides the arguments  required by the  format
    specification.   If  only one argument is  required and this is  not
    a  list of  ASCII values the  argument need  not be put  in a  list.
    Otherwise the arguments are put in a list.

    Special sequences start  with the tilde (~), followed by an optional
    numeric  argument, followed by a character describing the  action to
    be  undertaken.  A numeric argument is either a sequence  of digits,
    representing  a  positive decimal  number, a  sequence `<_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r>,
    representing  the ASCII value of the character (only useful  for ~t)
    or  a asterisk (*), in when  the numeric argument is taken  from the
    next  argument of  the argument  list,  which should  be a  positive
    integer.  Actions are:

      ~  Output the tilde itself.

      a  Output the  next  argument, which  should  be an  atom.    This
         option is equivalent to ww.  Compatibility reasons only.

      c  Output the  next argument  as an ASCII  value.   This  argument
         should be an  integer in the range  [0, ..., 255] (including  0
         and 255).

      d  Output  next argument  as  a decimal  number.    It  should  be
         an integer.    If  a numeric  argument is  specified  a dot  is
         inserted _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t  positions from the  right (useful for  doing
         fixed point arithmetic with integers, such as  handling amounts
         of money).

      D  Same as dd, but  makes large values easier to read  by inserting
         a comma every three digits left to the dot or right.

      e  Output next argument as a floating point  number in exponential
         notation.    The  numeric  argument  specifies  the  precision.
         Default is  6 digits.   Exact representation  depends on the  C
         library function printf().   This function is invoked  with the
         format %.<_p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n>e.

      E  Equivalent  to ee,  but  outputs a  capital  E to  indicate  the
         exponent.

      f  Floating point  in non-exponential  notation.    See C  library
         function printf().

      g  Floating point in ee or ff notation, whichever is shorter.

      G  Floating point in EE or ff notation, whichever is shorter.

      i  Ignore  next argument  of  the  argument  list.    Produces  no
         output.

      k  Give the next argument to displayq/1 (canonical write).

      n  Output a newline character.

      N  Only output  a newline  if the  last character  output on  this
         stream was not a newline.  Not properly implemented yet.

      p  Give the next argument to print/1.

      q  Give the next argument to writeq/1.

      r  Print integer  in radix the  numeric argument  notation.   Thus
         ~16r prints its argument  hexadecimal.  The argument  should be
         in the range [2; :::;36].   Lower case letters are used for  digits
         above 9.

      R  Same as rr, but uses upper case letters for digits above 9.

      s  Output a string of  ASCII characters or a string  (see string/1
         and section 3.23) from the next argument.

      t  All remaining space between 2 tabs tops  is distributed equally
         over ~t  statements  between the  tabs  tops.   This  space  is
         padded with  spaces by  default.   If an  argument is  supplied
         this is taken to be  the ASCII value of the character  used for
         padding.   This  can be  used to  do left  or right  alignment,
         centering, distributing, etc.   See also  ~| and ~+ to set  tab
         stops.  A tabs top is assumed at the start of each line.

      |  Set a  tabs top on  the current position.    If an argument  is
         supplied set  a  tabs top  on the  position  of that  argument.
         This  will  cause  all  ~t's  to  be  distributed  between  the
         previous and this tabs top.

      +  Set a tabs top relative  to the current position.   Further the
         same as ~|.

      w  Give the next argument to write/1.

      W  Give the  next two argument  to write_term/2.   This option  is
         SWI-Prolog specific.

    Example:

    simple_statistics :-
        <obtain statistics>         % left to the user
        format('~tStatistics~t~72|~n~n'),
        format('Runtime: ~`.t ~2f~34|  Inferences: ~`.t ~D~72|~n',
                                                [RunT, Inf]),
        ....

    Will output

    If  a sequence ~c (tilde, followed by some character) is  found, the
    format  derivatives will first check whether the user has  defined a
    predicate  to handle the format.   If  not, the built in  formatting
    rules  described above are  used.   _C_h_a_r is  either an ascii  value,
    or  a one character atom,  specifying the letter to be  (re)defined.
    _H_e_a_d  is a  term, whose  name and  arity are used  to determine  the
    predicate  to call  for  the redefined  formatting character.    The
    first  argument to  the  predicate is  the numeric  argument of  the
    format  command, or the  atom default if  no argument is  specified.
    The  remaining arguments  are filled from  the argument  list.   The
    example  below redefines ~n to produce _A_r_g times return  followed by
    linefeed (so a (Grr.)  DOS machine is happy with the output).

    Enumerates  all  user-defined  format  predicates.     _C_o_d_e  is  the
    character  code  of the  format character.    _H_e_a_d  is unified  with
    a  term with  the same  name and  arity as the  predicate.   If  the
    predicate  does not reside  in module user,  _H_e_a_d is qualified  with
    the definition module of the predicate.

The  following  predicates  form  a  simple  access   mechanism  to  the
Unix  termcap library  to provide  terminal independent  I/O for  screen
terminals.  These  predicates are only available on Unix machines.   The
SWI-Prolog Windows consoles accepts the ANSI escape sequences.

    Get  the  capability named  _N_a_m_e  from the  termcap  library.    See
    termcap(5)  for the capability  names.   _T_y_p_e specifies the type  of
    the  expected result, and is one of string, number or bool.   String
    results  are returned as  an atom, number  result as an integer  and
    bool  results as the atom on or off.   If an option cannot  be found
    this predicate fails  silently.  The results are only computed once.
    Successive queries on the same capability are fast.


ttttyy__ggoottoo((_+_X_, _+_Y))
    Goto  position  (_X, _Y) on  the screen.    Note  that the  predicates
    line_count/2  and  line_position/2 will  not  have  a  well  defined
    behaviour while using this predicate.


ttttyy__ppuutt((_+_A_t_o_m_, _+_L_i_n_e_s))
    Put  an  atom  via the  termcap  library  function tputs().     This
    function  decodes padding  information  in the  strings returned  by
    tty_get_capability/3 and  should be  used to  output these  strings.
    _L_i_n_e_s is the number  of lines affected by the operation, or 1 if not
    applicable (as in almost all cases).

ttttyy__ssiizzee((_-_R_o_w_s_, _-_C_o_l_u_m_n_s))
    Determine  the size of the terminal.   If the system provides  _i_o_c_t_l
    calls  for this these are used and  tty_size/2properly  reflects the
    actual  size after a user resize of the window.  As a  fallback, the
    system  uses tty_get_capability/2using  li and co capabilities.   In
    this case the reported  size reflects the size at the first call and
    is not updated after a user-initiated resize of the terminal.

    Execute  _C_o_m_m_a_n_d on the operating system.   _C_o_m_m_a_n_d is given to  the
    Bourne  shell (/bin/sh).  _S_t_a_t_u_s is unified with the exit  status of
    the command.

    On  _W_i_n_3_2  systems,  shell/[1,2]  executes  the  command  using  the
    CreateProcess()  API and  waits for the  command to  terminate.   If
    the  command  ends with  a &  sign,  the command  is  handed to  the
    WinExec()  API, which does not wait  for the new task to  terminate.
    See  also  win_exec/2  and  win_shell/2.     Please  note  that  the
    CreateProcess()  API does nnoott imply the Windows  command interpreter
    (command.exe  on  Windows  95/98  and  cmd.exe  on  Windows-NT)  and
    therefore  commands  built-in to  the command-interpreter  can  only
    be   activated  using  the  command  interpreter.      For  example:

    Win32  systems only.    Spawns a  Windows task  without waiting  for
    its  completion.  _S_h_o_w is  either iconic or normal and dictates  the
    initial  status of the window.   The iconic option is notably  handy
    to start (DDE) servers.

    Win32  systems only.    Opens the  document _F_i_l_e  using the  windows
    shell-rules  for doing  so.   _O_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n  is  one of  open, print  or
    explore  or  another operation  registered with  the  shell for  the
    given document-type.   On modern systems it is also possible to pass
    a  URL as _F_i_l_e, opening  the URL in Windows  default browser.   This
    call interfaces to the Win32 API ShellExecute().

    Win32  systems  only.     Fetches the  value  of  a  Win32  registry
    key.     _K_e_y  is  an  atom formed  as  a  path-name  describing  the
    desired  registry key.   _N_a_m_e is the  desired attribute name of  the
    key.    _V_a_l_u_e  is  unified with  the value.    If  the value  is  of
    type  DWORD, the  value is returned  as an  integer.   If the  value
    is  a string  it is  returned as  a Prolog atom.    Other types  are
    currently  not supported.  The  default `root' is HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
    Other  roots  can  be  specified  explicitely as  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT,
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER,  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  or  HKEY_USERS.  The  example

         are  passed as  Prolog  integers,  float arguments  and  Prolog
         floating  point  numbers and  all  other  arguments  as  Prolog
         atoms.  New applications should use the prolog-flag argv.

         A  stand-alone program  could  use  the following  skeleton  to
         handle command-line arguments.  See also section 2.10.2.4.

         main :-
                 unix(argv(Argv)),
                 append(_PrologArgs, [--|AppArgs], Argv), !,
                 main(AppArgs).


ggeett__ttiimmee((_-_T_i_m_e))
    Return  the number of  seconds that elapsed  since the epoch of  the
    POSIX,  tim representation:   January  1970,  0 hours.    _T_i_m_e is  a
    floating point number.  The granularity is system dependent.

    Convert   a  time  stamp,   provided  by   get_time/1,   time_file/2,
    etc.   _Y_e_a_r is  unified with the year,  _M_o_n_t_h with the month  number
    (January  is 1), _D_a_y  with the day of  the month (starting with  1),
    _H_o_u_r  with  the hour  of the  day (0--23),  _M_i_n_u_t_e  with the  minute
    (0--59).   _S_e_c_o_n_d with the  second (0--59) and _M_i_l_l_i_S_e_c_o_n_d with  the
    milliseconds  (0--999).  Note that the latter might not  be accurate
    or  might always be 0, depending  on the timing capabilities of  the
    system.  See also convert_time/2.

    Convert  a time-stamp as  obtained though get_time/1 into a  textual
    representation  using the C-library function ctime().  The  value is
    returned  as a  SWI-Prolog string object  (see section  3.23).   See

    Succeeds  if _F_i_l_e exists and can be accessed by this  prolog process
    under  mode _M_o_d_e.   _M_o_d_e is  one of the  atoms read, write,  append,
    exist,  none or execute.  _F_i_l_e may also be the name  of a directory.
    Fails  silently otherwise.   access_file(File, none)simply  succeeds
    without testing anything.

    If  `Mode' is write or append,  this predicate also succeeds if  the
    file  does not exist and the user has write-access to  the directory
    of the specified location.


eexxiissttss__ffiillee((_+_F_i_l_e))
    Succeeds  when _F_i_l_e exists.  This  does not imply the user  has read
    and/or write permission for the file.

    Extracts  the directory-part of _F_i_l_e.  The resulting  _D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y name
    ends  with the directory separator character /.  If _F_i_l_e is  an atom
    that does not  contain any directory separator characters, the empty
    atom '' is returned.  See also file_base_name/2.

    Extracts the filename part  from a path specification.  If _F_i_l_e does
    not contain any directory separators, _F_i_l_e is returned.

    Succeeds  if both filenames refer to  the same physical file.   That
    is,  if _F_i_l_e_1  and _F_i_l_e_2  are the  same string or  both names  exist
    and  point to the  same file (due to  hard or symbolic links  and/or
    relative vs.  absolute paths).

    Succeeds  if _D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y exists.    This does not  imply the user  has
    read, search and or write permission for the directory.


ddeelleettee__ffiillee((_+_F_i_l_e))

    Unify  the last  modification time of  _F_i_l_e with  _T_i_m_e.   _T_i_m_e is  a
    floating  point number expressing the  seconds elapsed since Jan  1,

    Expand  a local file-name into an absolute path.  The  absolute path
    is  canonised:  references to . and .. are deleted.   This predicate
    ensures  that expanding  a file-name  it returns  the same  absolute
    path  regardless of  how the  file is  addressed.   SWI-Prolog  uses
    absolute  file names  to register  source files  independent of  the
    current  working directory.    See also  absolute_file_name/3.    See
    also absolute_file_name/3 and expand_file_name/2.

    Converts  the  given  file  specification  into  an  absolute  path.
    _O_p_t_i_o_n is a list of options to guide the conversion:

    eexxtteennssiioonnss((_L_i_s_t_O_f_E_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_s))
         List of  file-extensions to  try.   Default is  ''.   For  each
         extension,  absolute_file_name/3 will first  add the  extension
         and then verify  the conditions imposed  by the other  options.
         If the  condition  fails, the  next extension  of  the list  is
         tried.   Extensions  may be specified  both as  ..ext or  plain
         ext.

    aacccceessss((_M_o_d_e))
         Imposes the condition  access_file(_F_i_l_e, _M_o_d_e).   _M_o_d_e is on  of
         read, write, append, exist or none.  See also access_file/2.

    ffiillee__ttyyppee((_T_y_p_e))
         Defines  extensions.    Current  mapping:   txt  implies  [''],
         prolog  implies ['.pl', ''],  executable  implies  ['.so', ''],
         qlf implies ['.qlf', ''] and directory implies [''].

    ffiillee__eerrrroorrss((_f_a_i_l_/_e_r_r_o_r))
         If error (default), throw and  existence_error exception  if the
         file cannot be found.  If fail, stay silent.

    ssoolluuttiioonnss((_f_i_r_s_t_/_a_l_l))
         If  first (default),  the  predicates leaves  no  choice-point.
         Otherwise a  choice-point  will be  left and  backtracking  may
         yield more solutions.

    True  if _F_i_l_e specifies  and absolute path-name.   On Unix  systems,
    this   implies  the  path  starts  with  a  `/'.      For  Microsoft
    based   systems  this  implies  the   path  starts  with  <_l_e_t_t_e_r>:.
    This   predicate   is  intended   to  provide   platform-independent
    checking  for  absolute paths.    See also  absolute_file_name/2 and
    prolog_to_os_filename/2.

    This  predicate is used to add, remove or test  filename extensions.
    The  main reason  for  its introduction  is to  deal with  different
    filename  properties  in a  portable manner.    If  the file  system
    is   case-insensitive,  testing  for  an  extension  will   be  done
    case-insensitive too.   _E_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n may be specified with or without a
    leading  dot (.).  If an _E_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n is generated, it will  not have a
    leading dot.

    Unify  _L_i_s_t with  a  sorted list  of files  or directories  matching
    _W_i_l_d_C_a_r_d.   The  normal Unix wildcard  constructs `?', `*',  `[...]'
    and  `{...}'  are  recognised.    The interpretation  of  `{...}'  is
    interpreted  slightly different  from  the C  shell (csh(1)).    The
    comma  separated  argument  can  be  arbitrary  patterns,  including
    `{...}'  patterns.  The empty pattern is  legal as well:  `\{.pl,\}'
    matches either `.pl' or the empty string.

    If  the pattern  does contains  wildcard  characters, only  existing
    files  and directories are returned.  Expanding a  `pattern' without
    wildcard  characters returns the argument, regardless on  whether or
    not it exists.

    Before  expanding wildchards, the construct $var is expanded  to the
    value  of the  environment  variable _v_a_r  and a  possible leading  ~
    character is expanded to the user's home directory..

    Converts  between the internal  Prolog pathname conventions and  the
    operating-system  pathname conventions.    The internal  conventions
    are  Unix and this predicates is  equivalent to =/2 (unify) on  Unix
    systems.   On  DOS systems it  will change the  directory-separator,
    limit  the filename length map dots,  except for the last one,  onto
    underscores.

    If _F_i_l_e points to  a symbolic link, unify _L_i_n_k with the value of the
    link and _T_a_r_g_e_t to  the file the link is pointing to.  _T_a_r_g_e_t points
    to  a file, directory or non-existing entry in the file  system, but
    never  to a link.   Fails if _F_i_l_e  is not a link.   Fails always  on
    systems that do not support symbolic links.

    Create  a name for a temporary file.  _B_a_s_e is an  identifier for the
    category  of file.  The _T_m_p_N_a_m_e is guaranteed to be unique.   If the
    system  halts, it  will automatically  remove all created  temporary
    files.

    Create  a  new directory  (folder) on  the filesystem.    Raises  an
    exception  on failure.   On Unix systems,  the directory is  created
    with default permissions (defined by the process _u_m_a_s_k setting).

SWI-Prolog multithreading is  based on standard C-language  multithread-
ing support.   It  is not like _P_a_r_L_o_g  or other paralel  implementations
of the Prolog language.   Prolog threads have their own stacks  and only
share the  Prolog _h_e_a_p:   predicates,  records, flags  and other  global
non-backtrackable data.  SWI-Prolog thread support is  designed with the
following goals in mind.

  o _M_u_l_t_i_-_t_h_r_e_a_d_e_d _s_e_r_v_e_r _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s
    Todays   computing  services  often   focus  on  (internet)   server
    applications.   Such applications often have need  for communication
    between  services  and/or  fast  non-blocking  service  to  multiple
    concurrent  clients.   The shared  heap provides fast  communication
    and  thread  creation  is  relatively cheap  (A  Pentium-II/450  can
    create and join approx.  10,000 threads per second on Linux 2.2).

  o _I_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s
    Interactive   applications   often   need   to   perform   extensive
    computation.   If  such computations are  executed in a new  thread,
    the  main thread  can process events  and allow  the user to  cancel
    the  ongoing computation.    User interfaces can  also use  multiple
    threads,  each thread dealing  with input from  a distinct group  of
    windows.

    Each  Prolog thread runs  in a  C-thread, automatically making  them
    cooperate  with  _M_T_-_s_a_f_e foreign-code.    In addition,  any  foreign
    thread  can create its  own Prolog engine  for dealing with  calling
    Prolog from C-code.

    Create  a new Prolog thread  (and underlying C-thread) and start  it
    by  executing  _G_o_a_l.   If  the thread  is created  succesfully,  the
    thread-identifier  of the created thread is unified to _I_d.   _O_p_t_i_o_n_s
    is a list of options.  Currently defined options are:

    llooccaall((_K_-_B_y_t_e_s))
         Set the  limit to  which  the local  stack of  this thread  may
         grow.   If omited,  the limit  of the  calling thread is  used.
         See also the -L commandline option.

    gglloobbaall((_K_-_B_y_t_e_s))
         Set the  limit to  which the global  stack of  this thread  may
         grow.   If omited,  the limit  of the  calling thread is  used.
         See also the -G commandline option.

    ttrraaiill((_K_-_B_y_t_e_s))
         Set the  limit to  which  the trail  stack of  this thread  may
         grow.   If omited,  the limit  of the  calling thread is  used.
         See also the -T commandline option.

    aarrgguummeenntt((_K_-_B_y_t_e_s))
         Set the limit  to which the argument  stack of this thread  may
         grow.   If omited,  the limit  of the  calling thread is  used.
         See also the -A commandline option.

    aalliiaass((_A_l_i_a_s_N_a_m_e))
         Associate an `alias-name' with  the thread.  This named  may be
         used to refer to the thread and remains valid  until the thread
         is joined (see thread_join/2).

    ddeettaacchheedd((_B_o_o_l))
         If  false  (default),  the  thread  can  be  waited  for  using
         thread_join/2.  thread_join/2 must be called on this  thread to
         reclaim the all resources  associated to the thread.   If true,
         the system will reclaim all associated  resources automatically
         after the thread finishes.  Please not  that thread identifiers
         are freed  for  reuse after  a detached  thread  finishes or  a
         normal thread has been joined.

    The _G_o_a_l argument is  _c_o_p_i_e_d to the new Prolog engine.  This implies
    further  instantiation of this term  in either thread does not  have
    consequences  for the  other thread:   Prolog threads  do not  share
    data from their stacks.

    Calling  current_thread/2 does not influence any  thread.  See  also
    thread_join/2.   For threads that  have an alias-name, this name  is

         The _G_o_a_l of the thread has  been terminated using thread_exit/1
         with _T_e_r_m as argument.

    eexxcceeppttiioonn((_T_e_r_m))
         The _G_o_a_l of the  thread has been terminated due to  an uncaught

tthhrreeaadd__jjooiinn((_+_I_d_, _-_S_t_a_t_u_s))
    Wait  for the termination of thread with  given _I_d.  Then  unify the
    result-status (see  thread_exit/1) of the thread with  _S_t_a_t_u_s.  After
    this call, _I_d  becomes invalid and all resources associated with the
    thread are reclaimed.  See also current_thread/2.

    A thread  that has been completed without thread_join/2 being called
    on  it is  partly reclaimed:   the  Prolog stacks  are released  and
    the  C-thread is destroyed.  A small data-structure  represening the
    exit-status of  the thread is retained until thread_join/2 is called
    on the thread.

    Run  _G_o_a_l after the execution of  this thread has terminated.   This
    is  to be compared  to at_halt/1, but only  for the current  thread.
    These  hooks are ran regardless of  why the execution of the  thread
    has  been completed.   As  these hooks are  run, the return-code  is
    already available through current_thread/2.

Prolog  threads can  exchange data  using dynamic  predicates,  database
records, and  other globally shared  data.  In  addition, they can  send
messages to each other.   If a threads needs to wait for  another thread
until  that thread  has  produced some  data,  using only  the  database
forces the waiting  thread to poll the  database continuously.   Waiting
for  a message  suspends  the thread  execution  until the  message  has
arrived in its message queue.

    Place  _T_e_r_m in the message queue of the indicated thread  (which can
    even  be the message queue of itself (see thread_self/1).   Any term
    can  be placed in a message queue, but note that the term  is copied
    to  to receiving thread and variable-bindings  are thus lost.   This
    call returns immediately.


tthhrreeaadd__ggeett__mmeessssaaggee((_?_T_e_r_m))
    Examines the thread  message-queue and if necessary blocks execution
    until  a term that unifies  to _T_e_r_m arrives in  the queue.  After  a
    term  from the queue has been unified unified to _T_e_r_m, this  term is
    deleted from the queue and this predicate returns.

    Please  note that not-unifying messages remain in the queue.   After
    the  following has been  executed, thread 1  has the term b(_g_n_u)  in
    its queue and continues execution using _A is gnat.

    Examines  the thread  message-queue  and compares  the queued  terms
    with   _T_e_r_m  until  one  unifies  or  the  end  of  the   queue  has
    been  reached.    In  the first  case  the call  succeeds  (possibly
    instantiating  _T_e_r_m.   If no term from  the queue unifies this  call
    fails.

    Make thread _T_h_r_e_a_d_I_d execute  _G_o_a_l at the first opportunity.  In the
    current  implementation, this implies at the first pass  through the
    _C_a_l_l_-_p_o_r_t.   The  predicate thread_signal/2 itself places _G_o_a_l  into
    the signalled-thread's signal queue and returns immediately.

    Signals  (interrupts)  do  not  cooperate well  with  the  world  of
    multi-threading,  mainly  because the  status of  mutexes cannot  be
    guaranteed  easily.   At the call-port,  the Prolog virtual  machine
    holds no locks and therefore the asynchronous execution is safe.

    _G_o_a_l  can be any  valid Prolog goal,  including throw/1 to make  the
    receiving thread generate  an exception and trace/0 to start tracing
    the receiving thread.

All  internal Prolog  operations  are thread-safe.    This  implies  two
Prolog  threads  can  operate on  the  same  dynamic  predicate  without
corrupting the consistency  of the predicate.   This section deals  with
user-level  _m_u_t_e_x_e_s (called  _m_o_n_i_t_o_r_s  in  ADA or  _c_r_i_t_i_c_a_l_-_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s  by
Microsoft).   A  mutex is a  MMUUTTual EEXXclusive device,  which implies  at
most one thread can _h_o_l_d a mutex.

Mutexes are  used to  realise related  updates to  the Prolog  database.
With `related', we refer to the situation where  a `transaction' implies
two  or more  changes to  the Prolog  database.   For  example, we  have
a  predicate address/2,  representing the  address of  a  person and  we
want  to change  the address  by retracting  the old  and asserting  the
new address.    Between these  two operations the  database is  invalid:
this person  has either no  address or two  addresses (depending on  the
assert/retract order).

Here is how to realise a correct update:

:- initialization
        mutex_create(addressbook).

change_address(Id, Address) :-
        mutex_lock(addressbook),
        retractall(address(Id, _)),
        asserta(address(Id, Address)),
        mutex_unlock(addressbook).


mmuutteexx__ccrreeaattee((_?_M_u_t_e_x_I_d))
    Create  a mutex.  if _M_u_t_e_x_I_d  is an atom, a _n_a_m_e_d mutex  is created.
    If  it is  a variable,  an  anonymous mutex  reference is  returned.
    There is no limit to the number of mutexes that can be created.


mmuutteexx__ddeessttrrooyy((_+_M_u_t_e_x_I_d))
    Destroy  a mutex.    After this  call, _M_u_t_e_x_I_d  becomes invalid  and
    further references yield an existence_error exception.


mmuutteexx__lloocckk((_+_M_u_t_e_x_I_d))
    Lock  the mutex.   Prolog mutexes are  _r_e_c_u_r_s_i_v_e mutexes:  they  can
    be  locked multiple times by the same thread.  Only  after unlocking
    it  as many times as it  is locked, the mutex becomes  available for
    locking  by other threads.   If another thread has locked the  mutex
    the calling thread is suspended until to mutex is unlocked.

    If  _M_u_t_e_x_I_d is  an atom,  and there  is no current  mutex with  that
    name,  the  mutex  is  created automatically  using  mutex_create/1.
    This implies named mutexes need not be declared explicitly.

    Please  note that  locking and  unlocking mutexes  should be  paired
    carefully.    Especially make  sure to  unlock mutexes  even if  the
    protected  code  fails or  raises an  exception.    For most  common
    cases  use  with_mutex/2,  wich  provides a  safer way  for  handling
    prolog-level mutexes.

    Unlock  the mutex.  This can only be called if the mutex  is held by
    the  calling thread.   If this is  not the case,  a permission_error
    exception is raised.


mmuutteexx__uunnlloocckk__aallll
    Unlock  all  mutexes held  by the  current  thread.   This  call  is
    especially  useful  to handle  thread-termination using  abort/0  or
    exceptions.  See also thread_signal/2.

    Enumerates  all existing  mutexes.   If the  mutex is  held by  some
    thread,  _T_h_r_e_a_d_I_d  is  unified with  the  identifier of  te  holding
    thread and _C_o_u_n_t with  the recursive count of the mutex.  Otherwise,
    _T_h_r_e_a_d_I_d is [] and _C_o_u_n_t is 0.


wwiitthh__mmuutteexx((_+_M_u_t_e_x_I_d_, _:_G_o_a_l))
    Execute  _G_o_a_l while holding _M_u_t_e_x_I_d.  If _G_o_a_l  leaves choicepointes,
    these  are  destroyed  (as  in  once/1).    The  mutex  is  unlocked
    regardless  of whether _G_o_a_l succeeds, fails or raises  an exception.
    An  exception thrown by _G_o_a_l is  re-thrown after the mutex has  been
    successfully unlocked.  See also mutex_create/2.

    Although  described in  the thread-section,  this predicate is  also
    available  in the single-threaded  version, where it behaves  simply
    as once/1.

This library  defines a  couple of useful  predicates for  demonstrating
and debugging  multi-threaded applications.   This library is  certainly
not complete.


tthhrreeaaddss
    Lists  all  current threads  and their  status.   In  addition,  all
    `zombie'  threads  (finished  threads that  are  not  detached,  nor
    waited for) are joined to reclaim their resources.


iinntteerraaccttoorr
    Create  a  new console  and  run the  Prolog  toplevel in  this  new
    console.  See also attach_console/0.


aattttaacchh__ccoonnssoollee
    If  the current thread has no  console attached yet, attach one  and
    redirect  the user  streams (input,  output, and error)  to the  new
    console  window.  The console is an xterm application.   For this to
    work,  you should be  running X-windows and  your xterm should  know
    the -Sccn.

    This  predicate has  a couple  of useful applications.    One is  to
    separate (debugging) I/O  of different threads.  Another is to start
    debugging  a thread that  is running in the  background.  If  thread
    10  is running,  the following  sequence starts the  tracer on  this
    thread:

    ?- thread_signal(10, (attach_console, trace)).

It is assumed that  the basic Prolog execution is thread-safe.   Various

bbrreeaakk
    Recursively  start a new  Prolog top level.   This Prolog top  level
    has its own  stacks, but shares the heap with all break environments
    and  the top level.  Debugging  is switched off on entering  a break
    and  restored on leaving one.   The break environment is  terminated
    by  typing the  system's end-of-file character  (control-D). If  the
    -t toplevel  command  line  option is  given  this goal  is  started
    instead of entering the default interactive top level (prolog/0).


aabboorrtt
    Abort  the Prolog  execution  and restart  the top  level.   If  the
    -t toplevel  command  line options  is given  this  goal is  started
    instead of entering the default interactive top level.

    There  are two  implementations of abort/0.    The default one  uses
    the  exception  mechanism  (see  throw/1),  throwing  the  exception
    $aborted.   The other one uses the C-construct longjmp()  to discard
    the  entire environment  and rebuild a  new one.   Using  exceptions
    allows  for  proper recovery  of predicates  exploiting  exceptions.
    Rebuilding  the  environment  is  safer if  the  Prolog  stacks  are
    corrupt.    Therefore the  system will use  the rebuild-strategy  if
    the  abort was generated  by an internal  consistency check and  the
    exception  mechanism otherwise.   Prolog  can be  forced to use  the
    rebuild-strategy  setting  the prolog  flag  abort_with_exception  to
    false.


hhaalltt
    Terminate  Prolog  execution.   Open  files are  closed  and if  the
    command  line option  -tty is  not active the  terminal status  (see
    Unix  stty(1)) is restored.  Hooks may be registered both  in Prolog
    and  in foreign code.  Prolog hooks  are registered using at_halt/1.
    halt/0 is equivalent to halt(0).


hhaalltt((_+_S_t_a_t_u_s))
    Terminate  Prolog  execution  with  given  status.    Status  is  an
    integer.  See also halt/0.

    This  goal starts the  default interactive top  level.  Queries  are
    read  from the stream user_input.   See also the history prolog_flag
    (current_prolog_flag/2).    The  prolog/0  predicate  is  terminated
    (succeeds)  by typing  the  end-of-file character  (On most  systems
    control-D).

The following  two hooks allow  for expanding  queries and handling  the
result  of a  query.   These  hooks are  used by  the toplevel  variable
expansion mechanism described in section 2.8.

This section is a  reference to the debugger interaction predicates.   A

If you have  installed XPCE, you can  use the graphical frontend of  the

    Start  the tracer.   trace/0  itself cannot be  seen in the  tracer.

    `trace the next goal'.

    Put  a  trace-point  on  all  predicates  satisfying  the  predicate
    specification  _P_r_e_d.   _P_o_r_t_s  is a  list of  portnames (call,  redo,
    exit,  fail).   The atom all refers  to all ports.   If the port  is
    preceded  by a - sign the trace-point  is cleared for the port.   If
    it is preceded by a + the trace-point is set.

    The  predicate trace/2  activates debug  mode (see debug/0).    Each
    time  a port (of the 4-port model) is passed that has  a trace-point
    set  the goal is printed as  with trace/0.  Unlike trace/0  however,
    the  execution is continued without asking for  further information.
    Examples:

        ?- trace(hello).         Trace all  ports of hello  with any
                                 arity in any module.
        ?- trace(foo/2, +fail).  Trace  failures  of  foo/2  in  any
                                 module.
        ?- trace(bar/1, -all).   Stop tracing bar/1.

    The predicate debugging/0 shows all currently defined trace-points.


nnoottrraaccee((_+_G_o_a_l))
    Call  _G_o_a_l,  but  suspend  the  debugger while  _G_o_a_l  is  executing.
    The  current  implementation cuts  the  choicepoints of  _G_o_a_l  after
    successful completion.   See once/1.  Later implementations may have
    the same semantics as call/1.


ddeebbuugg
    Start  debugger.     In  debug  mode,   Prolog  stops  at  spy-  and
    trace-points,  disables tail-recursion  optimisation and  aggressive
    destruction   of   choice-points  to   make  debugging   information
    accessible.  Implemented by the Prolog flag debug.


nnooddeebbuugg
    Stop  debugger.  Implementated by the  prolog flag debug.   See also
    debug/0.


ddeebbuuggggiinngg
    Print  debug status and  spy points on current  output stream.   See
    also the prolog flag debug.


ssppyy((_+_P_r_e_d))
    Put   a  spy   point  on  all   predicates  meeting  the   predicate
    specification _P_r_e_d.  See section 3.4.


nnoossppyy((_+_P_r_e_d))
    Remove   spy  point  from  all  predicates  meeting   the  predicate
    specification _P_r_e_d.

    Remove all spy points from the entire program.


lleeaasshh((_?_P_o_r_t_s))
    Set/query leashing (ports  which allow for user interaction).  _P_o_r_t_s
    is  one of _+_N_a_m_e, _-_N_a_m_e,  _?_N_a_m_e or a list  of these.  _+_N_a_m_e  enables
    leashing  on that  port,  _-_N_a_m_e disables  it and  _?_N_a_m_e succeeds  or
    fails  according to  the  current setting.    Recognised ports  are:
    call, redo, exit,  fail and unify.  The special shorthand all refers
    to  all ports, full  refers to all ports  except for the unify  port
    (default).  half refers to the call, redo and fail port.


vviissiibbllee((_+_P_o_r_t_s))
    Set the ports shown  by the debugger.  See leash/1 for a description
    of the port specification.  Default is full.


uunnkknnoowwnn((_-_O_l_d_, _+_N_e_w))
    Edinburgh-prolog  compatibility predicate,  interfacing  to the  ISO
    prolog  flag unknown.   Values are  trace (meaning error) and  fail.
    If  the unknown flag is set to warning, unknown/2 reports  the value
    as trace.


ssttyyllee__cchheecckk((_+_S_p_e_c))
    Set  style checking options.   _S_p_e_c  is either  +<_o_p_t_i_o_n>, -<_o_p_t_i_o_n>,
    ?<_o_p_t_i_o_n>  or a  list  of such  options.    +<_o_p_t_i_o_n> sets  a  style
    checking option,  -<_o_p_t_i_o_n>clears it and ?<_o_p_t_i_o_n> succeeds or fails
    according to the  current setting.  consult/1 and derivatives resets
    the  style checking options to their value before loading  the file.
    If---for  example---a file  containing long atoms  should be  loaded
    the user can start the file with:

    :- style_check(-atom).

    Execute  _G_o_a_l  just like  once/1 (i.e.  leaving  no choice  points),
    but  print used time, number  of logical inferences and the  average
    number  of  _l_i_p_s  (logical  inferences  per  second).     Note  that
    SWI-Prolog  counts the actual  executed number of inferences  rather
    than  the number of passes through  the call- and redo ports of  the
    theoretical 4-port model.

SWI-Prolog  offers  a  statistical  program  profiler  similar  to  Unix
prof(1) for C  and some other languages.   A profiler is used as  an aid
to find performance  pigs in programs.   It provides information on  the
time spent in the various Prolog predicates.

The  profiler  is  based  on the  assumption  that  if  we  monitor  the
functions on  the execution stack  on time  intervals not correlated  to
the program's execution the  number of times we find a procedure  on the
environment stack  is a  measure of  the time spent  in this  procedure.
It  is implemented  by calling  a procedure  each time  slice Prolog  is
active.   This procedure  scans the local stack  and either just  counts
the procedure on top  of this stack (plain profiling) or  all procedures
on  the stack  (cumulative profiling).    To get  accurate results  each
procedure  one is  interested  in should  have  a reasonable  number  of
counts.    Typically  a  minute runtime  will  suffice  to get  a  rough
overview of the most expensive procedures.


pprrooffiillee((_+_G_o_a_l_, _+_S_t_y_l_e_, _+_N_u_m_b_e_r))
    Execute  _G_o_a_l  just  like  time/1.    Collect  profiling  statistics
    according  to  style  (see  profiler/2)  and  show  the  top  _N_u_m_b_e_r
    procedures  on  the  current  output  stream  (see  show_profile/1).
    The  results  are kept  in  the database  until reset_profiler/0  or
    profile/3 is  called and can be displayed again with show_profile/1.
    profile/3 is the normal  way to invoke the profiler.  The predicates
    below are low-level predicates that can be used for special cases.


sshhooww__pprrooffiillee((_+_N_u_m_b_e_r))
    Show  the collected  results of the  profiler.   Stops the  profiler
    first  to avoid interference from show_profile/1.  It shows  the top
    _N_u_m_b_e_r predicates according the percentage cpu-time used.


pprrooffiilleerr((_-_O_l_d_, _+_N_e_w))
    Query  or change  the status of  the profiler.   The  status is  one
    of  off,  plain or  cumulative.    plain implies  the  time used  by
    children  of a predicate is not added to the time of  the predicate.
    For  status cumulative  the time  of children is  added (except  for
    recursive  calls).     Cumulative profiling  implies  the  stack  is
    scanned  up  to the  top  on  each time  slice  to find  all  active
    predicates.    This implies the  overhead grows  with the number  of
    active  frames on the stack.  Cumulative profiling  starts debugging
    mode  to disable tail recursion optimisation, which  would otherwise
    remove  the necessary  parent environments.   Switching status  from
    plain  to cumulative  resets the profiler.    Switching to and  from
    status  off does not reset  the collected statistics, thus  allowing
    to suspend profiling for certain parts of the program.

    Obtain profile statistics  of the predicate specified by _H_e_a_d.  _H_e_a_d
    is  an atom  for predicates with  arity 0  or a term  with the  same
    name and  arity as the predicate required (see current_predicate/2).
    _C_a_l_l_s  is unified with the number  of `calls' and `redos' while  the
    profiler was active.   _P_r_o_m_i_l_a_g_e is unified with the relative number
    of  counts the predicate  was active (cumulative)  or on top of  the
    stack (plain).  _P_r_o_m_i_l_a_g_e is an integer between 0 and 1000.

that do  not offer  dynamic stack expansion.    On these machines  these
predicates simply succeed to improve portability.


ggaarrbbaaggee__ccoolllleecctt
    Invoke  the global-  and trail  stack garbage collector.    Normally
    the  garbage   collector  is  invoked  automatically  if  necessary.
    Explicit  invocation  might   be  useful  to  reduce  the  need  for
    garbage  collections in time critical segments  of the code.   After
    the  garbage  collection  trim_stacks/0 is  invoked to  release  the
    collected memory resources.


ggaarrbbaaggee__ccoolllleecctt__aattoommss

    Limit one of the  stack areas to the specified value.  _K_e_y is one of
    local,  global or trail.   The limit  is an integer, expressing  the
    desired  stack limit in K  bytes.  If  the desired limit is  smaller
    than  the currently  used value,  the limit  is set  to the  nearest
    legal  value above the currently used  value.  If the desired  value
    is  larger than the maximum, the maximum is taken.  Finally,  if the
    desired value is either  0 or the atom unlimited the limit is set to
    its  maximum.   The maximum and initial  limit is determined by  the
    command line options -L, -G and -T.


ttrriimm__ssttaacckkss
    Release  stack memory resources that are not in use at  this moment,
    returning them to the  operating system.  Trim stack is a relatively
    cheap  call.    It can  be used  to release  memory  resources in  a
    backtracking  loop, where the  iterations require typically  seconds
    of execution time  and very different, potentially large, amounts of
    stack space.  Such a loop should be written as follows:

    loop :-
            generator,
                trim_stacks,
                potentially_expensive_operation,
            stop_condition, !.

    The  prolog top level  loop is written  this way, reclaiming  memory
    resources after every user query.

    Query/set  a parameter  for the  runtime stacks.   _S_t_a_c_k  is one  of
    local,  global, trail or  argument.   The table below describes  the

The  predicates in  this  section  deal with  MS-Windows  `Dynamic  Data
Exchange'  or DDE  protocol.    A Windows  DDE  conversation is  a  form
of interprocess  communication based  on sending reserved  window-events
between the communicating processes.

The DDE client interface  allows Prolog to talk to DDE  server programs.
We  will demonstrate  the use  of the  DDE interface  using the  Windows
PROGMAN (Program Manager) application:

1 ?- open_dde_conversation(progman, progman, C).

C = 0
2 ?- dde_request(0, groups, X)

--> Unifies X with description of groups

3 ?- dde_execute(0, '[CreateGroup("DDE Demo")]').

Yes

4 ?- close_dde_conversation(0).

Yes

For  details   on  interacting  with   progman,   use  the  SDK   online
manual  section on  the  Shell  DDE interface.     See also  the  Prolog
library(progman),  which  may be  used  to  write simple  Windows  setup
scripts in Prolog.

    Request  a value from the server.   _I_t_e_m is an atom  that identifies
    the  requested  data,  and  _V_a_l_u_e will  be  a string  (CF_TEXT  data
    in  DDE  parlance)  representing  that  data,   if  the  request  is

    SWI-Prolog  string objects  to return  the value  rather then  atoms
    to  reduce the  load on  the atom-space.    See section  3.23 for  a

The (autoload)  library(dde) defines  primitives to  realise simple  DDE
server applications in  SWI-Prolog.  These  features are provided as  of
version 2.0.6 and should be regarded prototypes.  The  C-part of the DDE
server can  handle some  more primitives,  so if you  need features  not
provided by this interface, please study library(dde).

    Register  a server  to handle  DDE request or  DDE execute  requests
    from  other applications.  To register a service for a  DDE request,
    _T_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is of the form:

         +Service(+Topic, +Item, +Value)

    _S_e_r_v_i_c_e  is the name  of the DDE  service provided (like progman  in
    the  client example  above).   _T_o_p_i_c is either  an atom,  indicating
    _G_o_a_l  only handles requests  on this topic  or a variable that  also
    appears  in _G_o_a_l.  _I_t_e_m and _V_a_l_u_e are variables that also  appear in
    _G_o_a_l.  _I_t_e_m represents the request data as a Prolog atom.

    The   example  below  registers   the  Prolog  current_prolog_flag/2
    predicate  to be accessible  from other applications.   The  request
    may  be  given  from  the  same  Prolog  as  well  as  from  another
    application.

    ?- dde_register_service(prolog(current_prolog_flag, F, V),
                            current_prolog_flag(F, V)).

    ?- open_dde_conversation(prolog, current_prolog_flag, Handle),
       dde_request(Handle, home, Home),
       close_dde_conversation(Handle).

    Home = '/usr/local/lib/pl-2.0.6/'

    Handling  DDE execute requests  is very similar.   In this case  the
    template is of the form:

         +Service(+Topic, +Item)

    Passing  a _V_a_l_u_e argument is  not needed as execute requests  either
    succeed  or fail.  If _G_o_a_l  fails, a `not processed' is  passed back
    to the caller of the DDE request.

In  traditional Prolog  systems the  predicate  space was  flat.    This
approach   is  not   very  suitable   for  the   development  of   large
applications, certainly not if these applications are  developed by more
than  one programmer.     In many  cases,  the  definition of  a  Prolog
predicate requires  sub-predicates that  are intended  only to  complete
the definition of the main predicate.  With a  flat and global predicate
space these support predicates will be visible from the entire program.

For this reason,  it is desirable that  each source module has it's  own
predicate space.    A module consists  of a  declaration for it's  name,
it's _p_u_b_l_i_c  _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_s and the  predicates themselves.   This  approach
allow the programmer  to use short (local) names for  support predicates
without worrying  about name  conflicts with the  support predicates  of
other  modules.    The  module  declaration also  makes  explicit  which
predicates are  meant for public usage  and which for private  purposes.
Finally,  using the  module information,  cross  reference programs  can
indicate possible problems much better.

Two approaches to  realize a module system  are commonly used in  Prolog
and other  languages.  The  first one is  the _n_a_m_e _b_a_s_e_d module  system.
In these  systems, each  atom read  is tagged  (normally prefixed)  with
the module  name, with  the exception  of those atoms  that are  defined
_p_u_b_l_i_c.   In the  second approach, each  module actually implements  its
own predicate space.

A  critical  problem with  using  modules  in Prolog  is  introduced  by
the  meta-predicates  that  transform between  Prolog  data  and  Prolog
predicates.  Consider the case where we write:

:- module(extend, [add_extension/3]).

add_extension(Extension, Plain, Extended) :-
        maplist(extend_atom(Extension), Plain, Extended).

extend_atom(Extension, Plain, Extended) :-
        concat(Plain, Extension, Extended).

In this case  we would like maplist to  call extend_atom/3 in the  module
extend.   A name based module  system will do this  correctly.  It  will
tag the atom  extend_atom  with the module and  maplist will use this  to
construct the tagged  term extend_atom/3.   A name based module  however,
will not only tag the  atoms that will eventually be used to refer  to a
predicate, but aallll atoms that are not declared public.   So, with a name
based module system also  data is local to the module.   This introduces
another serious problem:

:- module(action, [action/3]).

action(Object, sleep, Arg) :- ....
action(Object, awake, Arg) :- ....

:- module(process, [awake_process/2]).

awake_process(Process, Arg) :-
        action(Process, awake, Arg).

This code  uses a simple  object-oriented implementation technique  were
atoms are used as  method selectors.  Using a name based  module system,
this code will  not work, unless we  declare the selectors public  atoms
in all  modules that use them.   Predicate  based module systems do  not
require particular precautions for handling this case.

It  appears  we  have to  choose  either  to  have  local  data,  or  to
have  trouble with  meta-predicates.    Probably it  is best  to  choose
for  the  predicate  based approach  as  novice  users  will  not  often
write  generic meta-predicates  that  have to  be used  across  multiple
modules, but are likely  to write programs that pass data  around across
modules.   Experienced Prolog  programmers should be  able to deal  with
the complexities of meta-predicates in a predicate based module system.

Modules normally are  created by loading a _m_o_d_u_l_e  _f_i_l_e.  A module  file
is a file holding a module/2 directive as its first term.   The module/2
directive declares  the name  and the public  (i.e. externally  visible)
predicates of  the module.   The  rest of  the file is  loaded into  the
module.  Below is an example of a module file, defining reverse/2.

:- module(reverse, [reverse/2]).

reverse(List1, List2) :-
        rev(List1, [], List2).

rev([], List, List).
rev([Head|List1], List2, List3) :-
        rev(List1, [Head|List2], List3).

As  explained  before,  in  the  predicate  based  approach  adapted  by
SWI-Prolog, each  module has it's own predicate  space.  In  SWI-Prolog,
a module  initially is  completely empty.   Predicates  can be added  to
a  module by  loading a  module  file as  demonstrated in  the  previous
section, using assert or by _i_m_p_o_r_t_i_n_g them from another module.

Two mechanisms for  importing predicates explicitly from another  module
exist.   The use_module/[1,2] predicates load  a module file and  import
(part of  the) public predicates  of the file.   The import/1  predicate
imports any predicate from any module.


uussee__mmoodduullee((_+_F_i_l_e))
    Load  the  file(s) specified  with _F_i_l_e  just like  ensure_loaded/1.
    The  files should  all be  module files.    All exported  predicates
    from  the  loaded  files  are  imported  into  the  context  module.
    The  difference between  this predicate and  ensure_loaded/1 becomes
    apparent  if the file  is already  loaded into another  module.   In
    this  case ensure_loaded/1 does nothing;  use_module will import  all
    public predicates of the module into the current context module.


uussee__mmoodduullee((_+_F_i_l_e_, _+_I_m_p_o_r_t_L_i_s_t))
    Load  the file  specified  with _F_i_l_e  (only one  file is  accepted).
    _F_i_l_e  should be a module file.   _I_m_p_o_r_t_L_i_s_t is a list  of name/arity
    pairs  specifying the  predicates that should  be imported from  the
    loaded  module.   If a predicate is  specified that is not  exported
    from  the loaded module  a warning will be  printed.  The  predicate
    will nevertheless be imported to simplify debugging.


iimmppoorrtt((_+_H_e_a_d))
    Import predicate _H_e_a_d  into the current context module.  _H_e_a_d should
    specify the  source module using the <_m_o_d_u_l_e>:<_t_e_r_m>construct.  Note
    that  predicates are normally imported  using one of the  directives
    use_module/[1,2].    import/1  is meant  for handling  imports  into
    dynamically created modules.

It  would  be rather  inconvenient  to  have to  import  each  predicate
referred to by  the module, including the  system predicates.  For  this
reason each  module is  assigned a _d_e_f_a_u_l_t  _m_o_d_u_l_e.   All predicates  in
the default  module are  available without  extra declarations.    Their
definition however can be overruled in the local module.   This schedule
is implemented  by the exception handling  mechanism of SWI-Prolog:   if
an  undefined predicate  exception is  raised for  a  predicate in  some
module, the exception  handler first tries to import the  predicate from
the module's default module.  On success, normal execution is resumed.

SWI-Prolog contains two  special modules.   The first one is the  module
system.    This module  contains all  built-in  predicates described  in
this  manual.   Module  system has  no default  module  assigned to  it.
The second  special module is the  module user.   This module forms  the
initial  working space  of the  user.    Initially  it is  empty.    The
default module of module  user is system, making all  built-in predicate
definitions available  as defaults.    Built-in predicates  thus can  be
overruled by defining them in module user before they are used.

All other  modules default to module  user.   This implies they can  use
all predicates imported into user without explicitly importing them.

The  current structure  of  the module  system  has been  designed  with
some specific  organisations for  large programs  in mind.   Many  large
programs  define a  basic  library layer  on  top  of which  the  actual
program itself  is defined.    The module  user, acting  as the  default
module for all  other modules of the  program can be used to  distribute
these definitions over  all program module without introducing the  need
to  import this  common layer  each time  explicitly.   It  can also  be
used to  redefine built-in predicates  if this  is required to  maintain
compatibility  to some  other Prolog  implementation.    Typically,  the
loadfile of a large application looks like this:

:- use_module(compatibility).   % load XYZ prolog compatibility

:- use_module(                  % load generic parts
        [ error                 % errors and warnings
        , goodies               % general goodies (library extensions)
        , debug                 % application specific debugging
        , virtual_machine       % virtual machine of application
        , ...                   % more generic stuff
        ]).

:- ensure_loaded(
        [ ...                   % the application itself
        ]).

The  `use_module' declarations  will  import the  public predicates  from
the  generic  modules  into  the  user  module.     The  `ensure_loaded'
directive  loads the  modules that  constitute  the actual  application.
It is  assumed these  modules import  predicates from  each other  using
use_module/[1,2] as far as necessary.

In combination  with the  object-oriented schema described  below it  is
possible  to define  a neat  modular  architecture.   The  generic  code
defines general utilities  and the message passing predicates  (invoke/3
in the  example below).    The application modules  define classes  that
communicate using the message passing predicates.

Another typical  way to use  the module system  is for defining  classes
within  an object  oriented  paradigm.    The  class structure  and  the
methods  of  a class  can  be  defined  in a  module  and  the  explicit
module-boundary overruling  describes in  section 4.6.2 can  by used  by
the message passing  code to invoke the behaviour.   An outline of  this
mechanism is given below.

%       Define class point

:- module(point, []).           % class point, no exports

%        name           type,           default access
%                                       value

variable(x,             integer,        0,      both).
variable(y,             integer,        0,      both).

%         method name   predicate name  arguments

behaviour(mirror,       mirror,         []).

mirror(P) :-
        fetch(P, x, X),
        fetch(P, y, Y),
        store(P, y, X),
        store(P, x, Y).

The predicates fetch/3  and store/3 are predicates that change  instance
variables of instances.  The figure below indicates  how message passing
can easily be implemented:

%       invoke(+Instance, +Selector, ?ArgumentList)
%       send a message to an instance

invoke(I, S, Args) :-
        class_of_instance(I, Class),
        Class:behaviour(S, P, ArgCheck), !,
        convert_arguments(ArgCheck, Args, ConvArgs),
        Goal =.. [P|ConvArgs],
        Class:Goal.

The construct  <_M_o_d_u_l_e>:<_G_o_a_l> explicitly  calls _G_o_a_l  in module  _M_o_d_u_l_e.
It is discussed in more detail in section 3.8.

As indicated  in the introduction,  the problem  with a predicate  based
module system lies in the difficulty to find the  correct predicate from
a Prolog  term.   The predicate `solution(Solution)'  can exist in  more
than one  module, but `assert(solution(4))'  in some module is  supposed
to refer to the correct version of solution/1.

Various  approaches are  possible to  solve this  problem.    One is  to
add an extra  argument to all predicates (e.g. `assert(Module,  Term)').
Another is to tag  the term somehow to indicate which module  is desired
(e.g. `assert(Module:Term)').   Both approaches are not very  attractive
as  they make  the user  responsible for  choosing  the correct  module,
inviting  unclear  programming by  asserting  in  other modules.     The
predicate assert/1  is supposed  to assert  in the module  it is  called
from and should do  so without being told explicitly.  For  this reason,
the notion _c_o_n_t_e_x_t _m_o_d_u_l_e has been introduced.


44..66..11 DDeeffiinniittiioonn aanndd CCoonntteexxtt MMoodduullee

Each  predicate  of  the program  is  assigned  a  module,  called  it's
_d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n _m_o_d_u_l_e.   The definition module of a predicate is  always the
module in which the predicate was originally defined.   Each active goal
in the Prolog system has a _c_o_n_t_e_x_t _m_o_d_u_l_e assigned to it.

The  context module  is used  to  find predicates  from a  Prolog  term.
By  default, this  module  is the  definition  module of  the  predicate
running the  goal.   For meta-predicates  however, this  is the  context
module of the  goal that invoked them.   We call this _m_o_d_u_l_e___t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t
in SWI-Prolog.    In the `using  maplist' example  above, the  predicate
maplist/3  is declared  module_transparent.    This  implies the  context
module remains extend, the  context module of add_extension/3.   This way
maplist/3 can decide to call extend_atom in module extend rather than in
it's own definition module.

All built-in predicates that  refer to predicates via a Prolog  term are
declared module_transparent.  Below is the code defining maplist.

:- module(maplist, maplist/3).

:- module_transparent maplist/3.

%       maplist(+Goal, +List1, ?List2)
%       True if Goal can successfully be applied to all succes-
sive pairs
%       of elements of List1 and List2.

maplist(_, [], []).
maplist(Goal, [Elem1|Tail1], [Elem2|Tail2]) :-
        apply(Goal, [Elem1, Elem2]),
        maplist(Goal, Tail1, Tail2).

The  mechanism  above  is sufficient  to  create  an  acceptable  module
system.   There are however cases in which  we would like to be  able to
overrule this  schema and  explicitly call  a predicate  in some  module
or assert  explicitly in some  module.   The first  is useful to  invoke
goals  in  some module  from  the  user's  toplevel or  to  implement  a
object-oriented system (see above).  The latter is  useful to create and
modify _d_y_n_a_m_i_c _m_o_d_u_l_e_s (see section 4.7).

For  this purpose,  the reserved  term :/2  has  been introduced.    All
built-in predicates  that transform  a term into  a predicate  reference
will check whether  this term is of  the form `<_M_o_d_u_l_e>:<_T_e_r_m>'.  If  so,
the predicate is  searched for in _M_o_d_u_l_e  instead of the goal's  context
module.   The :  operator may be  nested, in  which case the  inner-most
module is used.

The special  calling construct  <_M_o_d_u_l_e>:<_G_o_a_l>pretends  _G_o_a_l is  called
from _M_o_d_u_l_e instead of the context module.  Examples:

?- assert(world:done).  % asserts done/0 into module world
?- world:assert(done).  % the same
?- world:done.          % calls done/0 in module world

So  far,   we  discussed  modules  that   were  created  by  loading   a
module-file.     These  modules  have  been   introduced  on  facilitate
the  development  of  large  applications.     The   modules  are  fully
defined at  load-time of the  application and  normally will not  change
during  execution.   Having  the  notion of  a set  of  predicates as  a
self-contained world can be attractive for other purposes as  well.  For
example, assume  an application that  can reason about multiple  worlds.
It is attractive  to store the data of  a particular world in a  module,
so we extract information from a world simply by  invoking goals in this
world.

Dynamic modules  can easily  be created.   Any  built-in predicate  that
tries  to locate  a predicate  in  a specific  module will  create  this
module as a side-effect if it did not yet exist.  Example:

?- assert(world_a:consistent),
   world_a:unknown(_, fail).

These  calls  create  a  module  called  `world_a'  and  make  the  call
`world_a:consistent'  succeed.  Undefined  predicates will not start  the
tracer or autoloader for this module (see unknown/2).

Import and  export from dynamically  created world  is arranged via  the
predicates import/1 and export/1:

?- world_b:export(solve(_,_)).          % exports solve/2 from world_b
?- world_c:import(world_b:solve(_,_)).  % and import it to world_c

    This directive can only  be used as the first term of a source file.
    It  declares  the file  to be  a _m_o_d_u_l_e  _f_i_l_e,  defining _M_o_d_u_l_e  and
    exporting  the predicates of  _P_u_b_l_i_c_L_i_s_t.   _P_u_b_l_i_c_L_i_s_t is a list  of

The  principles behind  the  module system  of  SWI-Prolog differ  in  a
number of aspects from the Quintus Prolog module system.

  o The  SWI-Prolog module  system allows  the user  to redefine  system
    predicates.

  o All  predicates that are  available in the  system and user  modules
    are visible in all other modules as well.

  o Quintus  has the `meta_predicate/1' declaration were SWI-Prolog  has
    the module_transparent/1 declaration.

The meta_predicate/1 declaration  causes the  compiler to tag  arguments
that pass  module sensitive information  with the  module using the  :/2
operator.  This approach has some disadvantages:

  o Changing   a  meta_predicate   declaration  implies  all   predicates
    ccaalllliinngg  the predicate need to be reloaded.  This can  cause serious
    consistency problems.

  o It  does not help for dynamically defined predicates  calling module
    sensitive predicates.

  o It   slows  down   the  compiler   (at  least   in  the   SWI-Prolog
    architecture).

  o At  least within the  SWI-Prolog architecture the run-time  overhead
    is   larger  than  the   overhead  introduced  by  the   transparent
    mechanism.

Unfortunately  the   transparent  predicate   approach  also  has   some
disadvantages.   If a  predicate A passes  module sensitive information
to a  predicate B, passing  the same information to  a module sensitive
system predicate both  A and B  should be declared transparent.   Using
the Quintus approach only A  needs to be treated special (i.e. declared
with  meta_predicate/1).    A  second problem  arises if  the  body of  a
transparent  predicate uses  module sensitive  predicates  for which  it
wants to refer to its  own module.  Suppose we want to  define findall/3
using assert/1  and retract/1.    The example  in figure  4.1 gives  the
solution.
:- module(findall, [findall/3]).

:- dynamic

        solution/1.

:- module_transparent
        findall/3,
        store/2.

findall(Var, Goal, Bag) :-

        assert(findall:solution('$mark')),
        store(Var, Goal),
        collect(Bag).

store(Var, Goal) :-
        Goal,                   % refers to context module of
                                % caller of findall/3
        assert(findall:solution(Var)),

        fail.

44..99..11 EEmmuullaattiinngg meta_predicate/1

The Quintus  meta_predicate/1 directive can  in many  cases be  replaced
by  the   transparent  declaration.      Below  is  the  definition   of
meta_predicate/1 as available from library(quintus).

:- op(1150, fx, (meta_predicate)).

meta_predicate((Head, More)) :- !,
        meta_predicate1(Head),
        meta_predicate(More).
meta_predicate(Head) :-
        meta_predicate1(Head).

meta_predicate1(Head) :-
        Head =.. [Name|Arguments],
        member(Arg, Arguments),
        module_expansion_argument(Arg), !,
        functor(Head, Name, Arity),
        module_transparent(Name/Arity).
meta_predicate1(_).             % just a mode declaration

module_expansion_argument(:).
module_expansion_argument(N) :- integer(N).

The discussion above  about the problems with the transparent  mechanism
show the two cases in which this simple transformation does not work.

SWI-Prolog      offers      a     powerful      interface      to      C
[Kernighan & Ritchie, 1978].     The  main  design   objectives  of  the
foreign language interface  are flexibility and performance.   A foreign
predicate  is a  C-function that  has the  same number  of arguments  as
the predicate  represented.   C-functions  are provided  to analyse  the
passed terms,  convert them to basic C-types  as well as to  instantiate
arguments using unification.   Non-deterministic foreign predicates  are
supported,  providing the  foreign  function with  a handle  to  control
backtracking.

C can  call Prolog  predicates, providing  both an  query interface  and
an interface  to extract  multiple solutions  from an  non-deterministic
Prolog predicate.   There is no limit  to the nesting of Prolog  calling
C, calling Prolog,  etc.  It is also  possible to write the `main'  in C
and use Prolog as an embedded logical engine.

A special include file called SWI-Prolog.h should be included  with each
C-source file  that is  to be  loaded via the  foreign interface.    The
installation process installs this file in the directory  include in the
SWI-Prolog home  directory (?- current_prolog_flag(home, Home).).   This
C-header file defines various data types, macros and  functions that can
be used  to communicate with  SWI-Prolog.  Functions  and macros can  be
divided into the following categories:

  o Analysing Prolog terms

  o Constructing new terms

  o Unifying terms

  o Returning control information to Prolog

  o Registering foreign predicates with Prolog

  o Calling Prolog from C

  o Recorded database interactions

  o Global actions on Prolog (halt, break, abort, etc.)

Foreign modules  may be linked to  Prolog in three  ways.  Using  _s_t_a_t_i_c
_l_i_n_k_i_n_g,  the  extensions,  a  small  description  file  and  the  basic
SWI-Prolog object  file are linked  together to  form a new  executable.
Using _d_y_n_a_m_i_c  _l_i_n_k_i_n_g, the  extensions are linked  to a shared  library
(.so file on  most Unix systems) or  dynamic-link library (.DLL file  on
Microsoft platforms) and loaded into the the running Prolog process..

The _s_t_a_t_i_c  _l_i_n_k_i_n_g schema can  be used on  all versions of  SWI-Prolog.
Whether or  not dynamic  linking is  supported can be  deduced from  the
prolog-flag  open_shared_object  (see current_prolog_flag/2).    If  this
prolog-flag yields true, open_shared_object/2 and related predicates are
defined.  See  section 5.4 for a suitable high-level interface  to these
predicates.

All  described  approaches  have  their  advantages  and  disadvantages.
Static linking  is portable and allows  for debugging on all  platforms.
It is relatively  cumbersome and the libraries  you need to pass to  the
linker may vary from  system to system, though the utility  program plld
described in section 5.7 often hides these problems from the user.

Loading  shared objects  (DLL  files on  Windows) provides  sharing  and
protection  and is  generally the  best choice.    If  a saved-state  is
created using qsave_program/[1,2], an initialization/1 directive  may be
used to load the appropriate library at startup.

Note  that  the  definition of  the  foreign  predicates  is  the  same,
regardless of the linking type used.

The interface  defined in this  section allows the  user to load  shared

This  interface is  portable to  Windows  as well  as to  Unix  machines
providing  dlopen(2)  (Solaris,  Linux,  FreeBSD, Irix  and  many  more)
or  shl_open(2) (HP/UX).  It  is  advised to  use  the  predicates  from
section 5.4 in your application.

    _F_i_l_e  is the name of a  .so file (see your C programmers  documenta-

    On  errors, an  exception shared_object(_A_c_t_i_o_n_, _M_e_s_s_a_g_e) is  raised.

    resolved  immediately rather  than lazy (default).   global  implies
    symbols of the  loaded object are visible while loading other shared

    be  supported by your operating system.  Check the  documentation of

    Search  for the  given foreign library  and link  it to the  current
    SWI-Prolog  instance.  The library may be specified with  or without
    the  extension.    First,  absolute_file_name/3 is  used  to  locate
    the  file.    If  this succeeds,  the  full path  is passed  to  the
    low-level  function  to open  the library.    Otherwise,  the  plain
    library  name  is passed,  exploiting  the operating-system  defined
    search  mechanism for  the shared  library.   The file_search_path/2
    alias  mechanism  defines the  alias foreign,  which  refers to  the
    directories <_p_l_h_o_m_e>/lib/<_a_r_c_h>and <_p_l_h_o_m_e>/lib, in this order.

    If  the library  can be loaded,  the function  called _E_n_t_r_y will  be
    called  without arguments.    The return  value of  the function  is
    ignored.

    The  _E_n_t_r_y  function  will  normally  call PL_register_foreign()  to

Below  is an  outline of  the files  structure  required for  statically
linking  SWI-Prolog  with  foreign extensions.     \ldots/pl  refers  to
the  SWI-Prolog  home  directory (see  current_prolog_flag/2).    <_a_r_c_h>
refers  to  the  architecture identifier  that  may  be  obtained  using
current_prolog_flag/2.

     .../pl/runtime/<_a_r_c_h>/libpl.a   SWI-Library
     \ldots/pl/include/SWI-Prolog.h  Include file
     \ldots/pl/include/SWI-Stream.h  Stream I/O include file
     \ldots/pl/include/SWI-Exports   Export declarations (AIX only)
     \ldots/pl/include/stub.c        Extension stub

The  definition   of  the  foreign  predicates   is  the  same  as   for
dynamic  linking.   Unlike  with dynamic  linking however,  there is  no
initialisation  function.   Instead,  the file  \ldots/pl/include/stub.c
may  be copied  to  your project  and  modified  to define  the  foreign
extensions.   Below is  stub.c, modified to  link the lowercase  example
described later in this chapter:

/*  Copyright (c) 1991 Jan Wielemaker. All rights reserved.
    jan@swi.psy.uva.nl

    Purpose: Skeleton for extensions
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <SWI-Prolog.h>

extern foreign_t pl_lowercase(term, term);

PL_extension predicates[] =
{
/*{ "name",      arity,  function,      PL_FA_<flags> },*/

  { "lowercase", 2       pl_lowercase,  0 },
  { NULL,        0,      NULL,          0 }     /* terminating line */
};

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{ PL_register_extensions(predicates);

  if ( !PL_initialise(argc, argv) )
    PL_halt(1);

  PL_install_readline();                /* delete if not required */

  PL_halt(PL_toplevel() ? 0 : 1);
}

Now, a new executable may be created by compiling  this file and linking
it to libpl.a from  the runtime directory and the libraries  required by
both the  extensions and the  SWI-Prolog kernel.   This  may be done  by
hand, or using the plld utility described in secrefplld.

55..55..11 TTyyppee term_t::  aa rreeffeerreennccee ttoo aa PPrroolloogg tteerrmm

The principal  data-type is term_t.   Type term_t is what Quintus  calls
QP_term_ref.   This name indicates  better what the type represents:   it
is a _h_a_n_d_l_e for a  term rather than the term itself.  Terms can  only be
represented and manipulated  using this type, as  this is the only  safe
way to  ensure the  Prolog kernel is  aware of  all terms referenced  by
foreign code  and thus allows the  kernel to perform  garbage-collection
and/or stack-shifts while foreign  code is active, for example  during a
callback from C.

A term  reference is  a C unsigned  long, representing  the offset of  a
variable on the Prolog environment-stack.  A foreign  function is passed
term references for the predicate-arguments, one for each  argument.  If
references for intermediate  results are needed, such references  may be
created using PL_new_term_ref() or PL_new_term_refs().   These references
normally live till the foreign function returns control  back to Prolog.
Their scope can  be explicitly limited using PL_open_foreign_frame() and
PL_close_foreign_frame()/PL_discard_foreign_frame().

A term_t  always refers to a valid Prolog term (variable,  atom, integer,
float  or compound  term).    A  term  lives either  until  backtracking
takes  us back  to a  point before  the term  was created,  the  garbage
collector  has collected  the  term or  the  term  was created  after  a
PL_open_foreign_frame()and PL_discard_foreign_frame()has been called.

The  foreign-interface functions  can either  _r_e_a_d,  _u_n_i_f_y or  _w_r_i_t_e  to
term-references.   In the  this document we  use the following  notation
for arguments of type term_t:

     term_t +t  Accessed   in  read-mode.       The   `+'
                indicates the argument is `input'.
     term_t -t  Accessed in write-mode.
     term_t ?t  Accessed in unify-mode.

Term references are obtained in any of the following ways.

  o _P_a_s_s_e_d _a_s _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t
    The  C-functions implementing  foreign predicates  are passed  their
    arguments  as term-references.    These  references may  be read  or
    unified.  Writing to these variables causes undefined behaviour.

  o _C_r_e_a_t_e_d _b_y PL_new_term_ref()
    A  term  created  by  PL_new_term_ref() is normally  used  to  build
    temporary  terms or be  written by one  of the interface  functions.
    For  example, PL_get_arg() writes a  reference to the  term-argument
    in its last argument.

  o _C_r_e_a_t_e_d _b_y PL_new_term_refs(_i_n_t _n)
    This   function  returns  a   set  of  term   refs  with  the   same
    characteristics as PL_new_term_ref().  See PL_open_query().

  o _C_r_e_a_t_e_d _b_y PL_copy_term_ref(_t_e_r_m___t _t)
    Creates a new term-reference  to the same term as the argument.  The
    term may be written to.  See figure 5.3.

Term-references  can safely  be  copied  to other  C-variables  of  type
term_t, but all copies will always refer to the same term.


term_t PPLL__nneeww__tteerrmm__rreeff()
    Return  a fresh reference  to a  term.   The reference is  allocated
    on  the _l_o_c_a_l  stack.   Allocating  a term-reference  may trigger  a
    stack-shift  on machines  that cannot  use sparse-memory  management
    for allocation the  Prolog stacks.  The returned reference describes
    a variable.


term_t PPLL__nneeww__tteerrmm__rreeffss(_i_n_t _n)
    Return  _n  new  term  references.     The  first  term-reference  is
    returned.   The others are _t +1, _t +2, etc.   There are two reasons
    for  using this function.   PL_open_query()expects the  arguments as
    a  set of  consecutive term references  and _v_e_r_y time-critical  code
    requiring a number of term-references can be written as:

    pl_mypredicate(term_t a0, term_t a1)
    { term_t t0 = PL_new_term_refs(2);
      term_t t1 = t0+1;

      ...
    }


term_t PPLL__ccooppyy__tteerrmm__rreeff(_t_e_r_m___t _f_r_o_m)
    Create a new term  reference and make it point initially to the same
    term  as _f_r_o_m.  This function  is commonly used to copy  a predicate
    argument to a term reference that may be written.


void PPLL__rreesseett__tteerrmm__rreeffss(_t_e_r_m___t _a_f_t_e_r)
    Destroy  all term  references that  have been  created after  _a_f_t_e_r,
    including  _a_f_t_e_r itself.    Any  reference to  the invalidated  term
    references after this call results in undefined behaviour.

    Note  that  returning  from  the  foreign  context  to  Prolog  will
    reclaim  all references  used in  the foreign  context.   This  call
    is  only necessary  if  references are  created inside  a loop  that
    never  exits  back to  Prolog.    See  also  PL_open_foreign_frame(),
    PL_close_foreign_frame() and PL_discard_foreign_frame().

Prolog implements two  mechanisms for avoiding stack overflow:   garbage
collection and stack expansion.   On machines that allow for  it, Prolog
will use virtual  memory management to detect stack overflow  and expand
the  runtime stacks.    On  other machines  Prolog will  reallocate  the
stacks and update all pointers to them.  To do so,  Prolog needs to know
which data is  referenced by C-code.  As  all Prolog data known by  C is
referenced through term references (term_t), Prolog has  all information
necessary to perform  its memory management without special  precautions
from the C-programmer.

aattoomm__tt An atom in Prologs  internal representation.  Atoms  are pointers
    to  an  opaque structure.    They are  a  unique representation  for
    represented  text, which  implies that  atom A  represents the same
    text as atom B  if-and-only-if A and B are the same pointer.

    Atoms  are  the  central  representation for  textual  constants  in
    Prolog  The  transformation  of C  a  character  string to  an  atom
    implies  a hash-table lookup.  If the same atom is needed  often, it
    is  advised to  store its reference  in a  global variable to  avoid
    repeated lookup.

ffuunnccttoorr__tt A  functor is  the  internal  representation of  a  name/arity
    pair.   They are used to find the name and arity of  a compound term
    as  well as to construct new compound  terms.  Like atoms  they live
    for the whole Prolog session and are unique.

If  Prolog encounters  a foreign  predicate  at run  time it  will  call
a  function  specified  in  the  predicate  definition  of  the  foreign
predicate.   The arguments 1;:::; <_a_r_i_t_y>pass the  Prolog arguments to the
goal as  Prolog terms.   Foreign  functions should  be declared of  type
foreign_t.   Deterministic foreign  functions have  two alternatives  to
return control back to Prolog:


_v_o_i_d PPLL__ssuucccceeeedd(())
    Succeed deterministically.  PL_succeed is defined as return TRUE.


_v_o_i_d PPLL__ffaaiill(())
    Fail  and  start  Prolog  backtracking.     PL_fail  is  defined  as
    return FALSE.

By  default   foreign  predicates   are  deterministic.      Using   the
PL_FA_NONDETERMINISTIC   attribute  (see   PL_register_foreign())  it   is
possible  to register  a  predicate  as a  non-deterministic  predicate.
Writing   non-deterministic   foreign  predicates   is   slightly   more
complicated  as  the  foreign function  needs  context  information  for
generating  the next  solution.   Note  that the  same foreign  function
should  be  prepared  to be  simultaneously  active  in  more  than  one
goal.     Suppose  the  natural_number_below_n/2  is  a  non-deterministic
foreign predicate, backtracking over all natural numbers  lower than the
first argument.  Now consider the following predicate:

quotient_below_n(Q, N) :-
        natural_number_below_n(N, N1),
        natural_number_below_n(N, N2),
        Q =:= N1 / N2, !.

In  this predicate  the function  natural_number_below_n/2  simultaneously
generates solutions for both its invocations.

Non-deterministic foreign functions  should be prepared to handle  three
different calls from Prolog:

  o _I_n_i_t_i_a_l _c_a_l_l _(PL_FIRST_CALL_)
    Prolog  has just created a frame  for the foreign function and  asks
    it to produce the first answer.

  o _R_e_d_o _c_a_l_l _(PL_REDO_)
    The previous invocation  of the foreign function associated with the
    current  goal indicated it was possible  to backtrack.  The  foreign
    function should produce the next solution.

  o _T_e_r_m_i_n_a_t_e _c_a_l_l _(PL_CUTTED_)
    The choice point  left by the foreign function has been destroyed by
    a  cut.  The foreign function is given the opportunity to  clean the
    environment.

Both  the  context  information  and  the  type  of   call  is  provided
by  an  argument  of  type  control_t  appended  to  the  argument  list
for  deterministic foreign  functions.   The  macro PL_foreign_control()
extracts  the   type  of  call   from  the  control   argument.      The
foreign  function  can  pass  a context  handle  using  the  PL_retry*()
macros  and  extract  the handle  from  the  extra  argument  using  the
PL_foreign_context*() macro.


_v_o_i_d PPLL__rreettrryy((_l_o_n_g))
    The  foreign function  succeeds while leaving  a choice  point.   On
    backtracking  over this  goal the  foreign function  will be  called
    again,  but the control argument now  indicates it is a `Redo'  call
    and  the macro  PL_foreign_context() will return  the handle  passed
    via  PL_retry().   This  handle is a 30  bits signed value (two  bits
    are used for status indication).


_v_o_i_d PPLL__rreettrryy__aaddddrreessss((_v_o_i_d _*))
    As  PL_retry(),  but ensures  an address as  returned by malloc()  is
    correctly recovered by PL_foreign_context_address().


_i_n_t PPLL__ffoorreeiiggnn__ccoonnttrrooll((_c_o_n_t_r_o_l___t))
    Extracts  the type of  call from the control  argument.  The  return
    values  are  described above.    Note that  the  function should  be
    prepared  to handle the PL_CUTTED case and should be aware  that the
    other arguments are not valid in this case.


_l_o_n_g PPLL__ffoorreeiiggnn__ccoonntteexxtt((_c_o_n_t_r_o_l___t))
    Extracts  the context from the context  argument.  In the call  type
    is  PL_FIRST_CALL the context value is 0L. Otherwise it  is the value
    returned  by the last PL_retry() associated with this goal  (both if
    the call type is PL_REDO as PL_CUTTED).


_v_o_i_d _* PPLL__ffoorreeiiggnn__ccoonntteexxtt__aaddddrreessss((_c_o_n_t_r_o_l___t))
    Extracts an address as passed in by PL_retry_address().

Note:  If a  non-deterministic foreign function returns using PL_succeed
or  PL_fail,   Prolog  assumes  the  foreign  function  has  cleaned  its
environment.  NNoo call with control argument PL_CUTTED will follow.

The code of figure 5.2 shows a skeleton for  a non-deterministic foreign
predicate definition.

atom_t PPLL__nneeww__aattoomm(_c_o_n_s_t _c_h_a_r _*)
    Return an atom handle  for the given C-string.  This function always

const char* PPLL__aattoomm__cchhaarrss(_a_t_o_m___t _a_t_o_m)
    Return  a C-string for the text represented by the given atom.   The
    returned  text will not be changed by Prolog.  It is  not allowed to
    modify  the contents, not even `temporary' as the string  may reside
    in read-only memory.

With  the introduction  of  atom-garbage  collection in  version  3.3.0,
atoms  no longer  have live  as long  as the  process.   Instead,  their
lifetime is  guaranteed only as  long as  they are referenced.   In  the
single-threaded version,  atom garbage collections  are only invoked  at
the _c_a_l_l_-_p_o_r_t.   In the multi-threaded  version (see section 3.39,  they
appear asynchronously, except for the invoking thread.

For dealing with  atom garbage collection, two additional  functions are
provided:


void PPLL__rreeggiisstteerr__aattoomm(_a_t_o_m___t _a_t_o_m)
    Increment  the reference count  of the  atom by one.   PL_new_atom()
    performs  this automatically,  returning  an atom  with a  reference
    count of at least one.


void PPLL__uunnrreeggiisstteerr__aattoomm(_a_t_o_m___t _a_t_o_m)
    Decrement  the reference count of the atom.  If  the reference-count
    drops below zero, an assertion error is raised.

Please note that the  following two calls are different with  respect to
atom garbage collection:

PL_unify_atom_chars(t, "text");
PL_unify_atom(t, PL_new_atom("text"));

The  latter increments  the  reference count  of  the atom  text,  which
effectively ensures the atom will never be collected.   It is adviced to
use the *_chars() or *_nchars() functions whenever applicable.

Each argument  of a foreign function  (except for the control  argument)
is of type term_t, an opaque  handle to a Prolog term.  Three  groups of
functions are  available for  the analysis  of terms.    The first  just
validates the type,  like the Prolog  predicates var/1, atom/1, etc  and
are  called PL_is_*().    The second  group  attempts to  translate  the
argument into a C primitive type.   These predicates take a term_t and a
pointer to the appropriate C-type and return TRUE or  FALSE depending on
successful or unsuccessful translation.   If the translation fails,  the
pointed-to data is never modified.

    Obtain  the type  of a  term,  which should  be a  term returned  by
    one  of the  other interface  predicates or passed  as an  argument.
    The  function  returns the  type  of  the Prolog  term.    The  type
    identifiers  are listed below.   Note that the extraction  functions
    PL_ge_t*() also validate  the type and  thus the two sections  below
    are equivalent.

The functions PL_is_<_t_y_p_e> are an alternative to PL_term_type().  The test
PL_is_variable(_t_e_r_m) is equivalent to  PL_term_type(_t_e_r_m)== PL_VARIABLE,
but  the first  is considerably  faster.   On  the other  hand, using  a
switch over  PL_term_type() is faster  and more readable  then using  an
if-then-else using  the functions  below.   All  these functions  return
either TRUE or FALSE.

The functions PL_get_*() read information from  a Prolog term.  Most  of
them take two arguments.  The first is the input  term and the second is
a pointer to the output value or a term-reference.

    If _t is an atom,  store the unique atom identifier over _a.  See also
    PL_atom_chars() and PL_new_atom().   If there is  no need to  access
    the data (characters)  of an atom, it is advised to manipulate atoms
    using  their handle.  As the  atom is referenced by _t, it  will live
    at  least as long as _t does.   If longer live-time is required,  the
    atom should be locked using PL_register_atom().

    If  _t is an atom, store a  pointer to a 0-terminated C-string  in _s.
    It is explicitly  nnoott allowed to modify the contents of this string.
    Some  built-in  atoms may  have the  string  allocated in  read-only
    memory, so `temporary manipulation' can cause an error.

    If  _t  is  a  string  object,  store a  pointer  to  a  0-terminated
    C-string  in _s  and the  length of  the string in  _l_e_n.   Note  that
    this pointer  is invalidated by backtracking, garbage-collection and
    stack-shifts,  so generally the only save operations are to  pass it
    immediately to a C-function that doesn't involve Prolog.

    Convert  the argument term _t to  a 0-terminated C-string.  _f_l_a_g_s  is
    a  bitwise disjunction  from two  groups of  constants.   The  first
    specifies  which term-types should converted and the second  how the
    argument  is stored.  Below  is a specification of these  constants.
    BUF_RING implies, if  the data is not static (as from an  atom), the
    data  is copied to the next buffer from a ring of 16 buffers.   This
    is  a convenient way  of converting multiple  arguments passed to  a
    foreign  predicate to C-strings.    If BUF_MALLOC  is used, the  data
    must be freed using free() when not needed any longer.

Terms  can  be  constructed  using  functions from  the  PL_put_*()  and
PL_cons_*()  families.    This  approach  builds the  term  `inside-out',
starting  at  the  leaves  and  subsequently  creating  compound  terms.
Alternatively,   terms  may  be  created   `top-down',  first   creating
a  compound  holding  only  variables  and   subsequently  unifying  the
arguments.   This section  discusses functions  for the first  approach.
This approach  is generally  used for  creating arguments  for PL_call()
and PL_open_query.

    using this function, the variable will continue to live.

    Create  a term,  whose arguments are  filled from variable  argument
    list  holding the same number of term_t objects as the arity  of the
    functor.  To create the term animal(gnu, 50), use:

    Create  a list (cons-) cell in _l from  the head and tail.   The code
    below  creates a list of  atoms from a char **.   The list is  built

The  functions  of  this  sections  _u_n_i_f_y  terms  with  other  terms  or
translated C-data structures.   Except for PL_unify(), the functions  of
this section  are specific  to SWI-Prolog.   They  have been  introduced
to make translation  of old code easier,  but also because they  provide
for a faster mechanism  for returning data to Prolog that  requires less
term-references.  Consider the case where we want  a foreign function to
return the  host name of the  machine Prolog is running  on.  Using  the
PL_get_*() and PL_put_*() functions, the code becomes:

foreign_t
pl_hostname(term_t name)
{ char buf[100];

  if ( gethostname(buf, sizeof(buf)) )
  { term_t tmp = PL_new_term_ref();

    PL_put_atom_chars(tmp, buf);
    return PL_unify(name, buf);
  }

  PL_fail;
}

Using PL_unify_atom_chars(), this becomes:

foreign_t
pl_hostname(term_t name)
{ char buf[100];

  if ( gethostname(buf, sizeof(buf)) )
    return PL_unify_atom_chars(name, buf);

    Unify  _t with a (normally) compound  term.  The remaining  arguments
    is  a  sequence  of a  type  identifier,  followed by  the  required
    arguments.      This  predicate  is  an  extension  to  the  Quintus
    and  SICStus foreign  interface  from which  the SWI-Prolog  foreign
    interface  has been  derived, but has  proved to  be a powerful  and
    comfortable  way to create compound terms from C. Due to  the vararg
    packing/unpacking and  the required type-switching this interface is
    slightly  slower than using the primitives.   Please note that  some
    bad  C-compilers have fairly low  limits on the number of  arguments
    that may be passed to a function.

    Special  attention is required when  passing numbers.  C  `promotes'
    any  integral  smaller than  int  to  int.    I.e. the  types  char,
    short  and  int  are all  passed  as int.    In  addition,  on  most
    32-bit  platforms int and  long are the same.   Upto version  4.0.5,
    only  PL_INTEGER  could be specified which  was taken from the  stack
    as  long.   Such  code fails when  passing small  integral types  on
    machines  where int  is smaller than  long.   It is  adviced to  use
    PL_SHORT, PL_INT or  PL_LONG  as appropriate.   Similar, C  compilers
    promote  float to  double and  therefore PL_FLOAT and  PL_DOUBLE  are
    synonyms.

    The type identifiers are:

    PL_VARIABLE nnoonnee
         No op.  Used in arguments of PL_FUNCTOR.

    PL_ATOM aattoomm__tt
         Unify the argument with an atom, as in PL_unify_atom().

    PL_SHORT sshhoorrtt
         Unify the argument  with an integer,  as in PL_unify_integer().
         As short is promoted to int, PL_SHORT is a synonym for PL_INT.

    PL_INT iinntt
         Unify the argument with an integer, as in PL_unify_integer().

    PL_LONG lloonngg
         Unify the argument with an integer, as in PL_unify_integer().

    PL_INTEGER lloonngg
         Unify the argument with an integer, as in PL_unify_integer().

    PL_DOUBLE ddoouubbllee
         Unify  the  argument  with a  float,  as  in  PL_unify_float().
         Note  that,  as the  argument  is  passed using  the  C  vararg
         conventions, a float must be casted to a double explicitly.

    PL_FLOAT ddoouubbllee

The  Prolog engine  can  be called  from  C.  There are  two  interfaces
for  this.    For the  first,  a  term is  created  that could  be  used
as an  argument to  call/1 and next  PL_call() is used  to call  Prolog.
This  system is  simple, but  does not  allow to  inspect the  different
answers  to a  non-deterministic  goal and  is  relatively slow  as  the
runtime  system needs  to  find the  predicate.    The  other  interface
is  based on  PL_open_query(),  PL_next_solution() and  PL_cut_query() or
PL_close_query().     This mechanism  is  more powerful,  but  also  more
complicated to use.

This  section  discusses   the  functions  used  to  communicate   about
predicates.   Though a Prolog predicate  may defined or not,  redefined,
etc., a Prolog predicate has a handle that is  not destroyed, nor moved.
This handle is known by the type predicate_t.


predicate_t PPLL__pprreedd(_f_u_n_c_t_o_r___t _f_, _m_o_d_u_l_e___t _m)
    Return  a handle to a predicate for the specified name/arity  in the
    given module.   This function always succeeds, creating a handle for
    an undefined predicate if no handle was available.


predicate_t PPLL__pprreeddiiccaattee(_c_o_n_s_t _c_h_a_r _*_n_a_m_e_, _i_n_t _a_r_i_t_y_, _c_o_n_s_t _c_h_a_r_* _m_o_d_u_l_e)

    Same   a  PL_pred(),   but   provides  a   more  convenient   inter-
    face to the C-programmer.


void PPLL__pprreeddiiccaattee__iinnffoo(_p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e___t _p_, _a_t_o_m___t _*_n_, _i_n_t _*_a_, _m_o_d_u_l_e___t _*_m)
    Return  information on the  predicate _p.   The  name is stored  over
    _n,  the  arity  over _a,  while  _m  receives the  definition  module.
    Note  that  the  latter need  not  be  the same  as  specified  with
    PL_predicate().    If the  predicate was  imported  into the  module
    given to  PL_predicate(), this function will  return the module where
    the predicate was defined.

This  section discusses  the  functions  for creating  and  manipulating
queries from C. Note that a foreign context can have  at most one active
query.    This  implies it  is allowed  to  make strictly  nested  calls
between  C and  Prolog (Prolog  calls C,  calls Prolog,  calls C,  etc.,
but it  is nnoott  allowed to  open multiple queries  and start  generating
solutions for  each of them by  calling PL_next_solution().   Be sure  to
call PL_cut_query() or PL_close_query() on any  query you opened  before
opening the next or returning control back to Prolog.


qid_t PPLL__ooppeenn__qquueerryy(_m_o_d_u_l_e___t _c_t_x_, _i_n_t _f_l_a_g_s_, _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e___t _p_, _t_e_r_m___t _+_t_0)

    Opens  a query  and returns  an identifier for  it.   This  function
    always  succeeds,  regardless whether  the predicate  is defined  or
    not.    _c_t_x is  the _c_o_n_t_e_x_t  _m_o_d_u_l_e of  the goal.    When NULL,  the
    context  module of  the calling  context will  be used,  or user  if
    there  is no calling  context (as may  happen in embedded  systems).
    Note  that the  context module  only matters  for _m_o_d_u_l_e___t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t
    predicates.   See context_module/1 and module_transparent/1.   The _p
    argument  specifies the  predicate, and  should be the  result of  a
    call  to PL_pred() or PL_predicate().   Note that  it is allowed  to
    store  this handle as global data  and reuse it for future  queries.
    The  term-reference _t_0 is the  first of a vector of  term-references
    as returned by PL_new_term_refs(_n).

    The  _f_l_a_g_s  arguments provides  some additional  options  concerning
    debugging  and  exception handling.    It  is a  bitwise or  of  the
    following values:

    PL_Q_NORMAL
         Normal operation.    The  debugger inherits  its settings  from
         the environment.   If an exception  occurs that is not  handled
         in Prolog, a  message is printed and  the tracer is started  to
         debug the error.

    PL_Q_NODEBUG
         Switch off the debugger while executing the goal.   This option
         is used by many  calls to hook-predicates to avoid  tracing the
         hooks.   An example is  print/1 calling portray/1 from  foreign
         code.

    PL_Q_CATCH_EXCEPTION
         If an  exception is  raised while  executing the  goal, do  not
         report it, but make it available for PL_exception().

    PL_Q_PASS_EXCEPTION
         As PL_Q_CATCH_EXCEPTION,  but do  not invalidate the  exception-
         term  while   calling  PL_close_query().      This  option   is
         experimental.

    The  example below opens a query to the predicate is_a/2  to find the
    ancestor of for some name.

    char *
    ancestor(const char *me)
    { term_t a0 = PL_new_term_refs(2);
      static predicate_t p;

      if ( !p )
        p = PL_predicate("is_a", 2, "database");

      PL_put_atom_chars(a0, me);
      PL_open_query(NULL, PL_Q_NORMAL, p, a0);
      ...
    }


int PPLL__nneexxtt__ssoolluuttiioonn(_q_i_d___t _q_i_d)
    Generate the first (next)  solution for the given query.  The return
    value  is TRUE if  a solution  was found, or  FALSE to indicate  the
    query  could not be proven.  This function may be  called repeatedly
    until it fails to generate all solutions to the query.


void PPLL__ccuutt__qquueerryy(_q_i_d)
    Discards  the query, but does not delete any of the data  created by
    the  query.   It just  invalidate _q_i_d,  allowing for a  new call  to
    PL_open_query() in this context.

    Shorthand  for  PL_open_query(),  PL_next_solution(),  PL_cut_query(),

    the  specified module, or in the context  module if module_t  = NULL.
    Returns  TRUE if  the call succeeds,  FALSE otherwise.   Figure  5.4

The Prolog  data created and  term-references needed  to setup the  call
and/or analyse  the result can  in most cases  be discarded right  after
the  call.   PL_close_query() allows  for  destructing the  data,  while
leaving the  term-references.   The calls below may  be used to  destroy
term-references and data.  See figure 5.4 for an example.


fid_t PPLL__ooppeenn__ffoorreeiiggnn__ffrraammee()
    Created  a foreign  frame,  holding a  mark that  allows the  system
    to  undo  bindings and  destroy data  created after  it  as well  as
    providing  the  environment  for  creating term-references.     This
    function   is  called  by  the  kernel  before  calling   a  foreign
    predicate.

    Discard  all term-references  created  after the  frame was  opened.
    All  other Prolog data is retained.  This function is called  by the
    kernel whenever a foreign function returns control back to Prolog.

    Undo all bindings  and discard all term-references created since the
    frame was created, but  does not pop the frame.  I.e. the same frame
    can  be rewinded multiple  times, and must  eventually be closed  or
    discarded.

It is obligatory to call either of the two  closing functions to discard
a foreign frame.  Foreign frames may be nested.

    construct  <_m_o_d_u_l_e>:<_r_e_s_t>this function will make _p_l_a_i_n a  reference
    to  <_r_e_s_t>  and fill  _m_o_d_u_l_e _*  with <_m_o_d_u_l_e>.    For further  nested

This     section    discusses     PL_exception(),     PL_throw()     and
PL_raise_exception(),  the  interface functions  to  detect and  generate
Prolog  exceptions from  C-code.    PL_throw()  and PL_raise_exception()
from  the  C-interface   to  raise  an  exception  from  foreign   code.
PL_throw() exploits the  C-function longjmp()  to return immediately  to
the  innermost PL_next_solution().   PL_raise_exception() registers  the
exception term and returns FALSE. If a foreign  predicate returns FALSE,
while  and exception-term  is  registered  a Prolog  exception  will  be
raised by the virtual machine.

Calling these functions  outside the context of a function  implementing
a foreign predicate results in undefined behaviour.

PL_exception() may  be used  after a  call to  PL_next_solution() fails,
and returns a  term reference to an  exception term if an exception  was
raised, and 0 otherwise.

If  a C-function,  implementing  a predicate  calls Prolog  and  detects
an  exception using  PL_exception(),  it can  handle  this exception,  or
return  with the  exception.    Some caution  is required  though.    It
is  nnoott allowed  to call  PL_close_query() or  PL_discard_foreign_frame()
afterwards,  as  this  will  invalidate  the  exception  term.     Below
is  the  code that  calls  a  Prolog defined  arithmetic  function  (see
arithmethic_function/1).

If PL_next_solution() succeeds,  the result  is analysed and  translated
to  a number,  after  which the  query  is closed  and all  Prolog  data
created  after  PL_open_foreign_frame() is  destroyed.    On  the  other
hand,  if  PL_next_solution() fails  and  if an  exception  was  raised,
just  pass it.     Otherwise generate  an  exception  (PL_error() is  an
internal  call  for  building  the  standard  error  terms  and  calling
PL_raise_exception()).    After this,  the Prolog  environment should  be
discarded  using  PL_cut_query() and  PL_close_foreign_frame() to  avoid
invalidating the exception term.

If  SWI-Prolog   has  been   build  to   support  multi-threading   (see
section 3.39), all  foreign-code linked to Prolog should  be thread-safe
(_r_e_e_n_t_r_a_n_t) or  guarded in Prolog  using with_mutex/2 from  simultaneous
access from multiple  Prolog threads.   On Unix systems, this  generally
implies the  code should be compiled  with the -D_REENTRANT flag  passed
to  the compiler.    Please  note  that on  many  Unix systems  not  all
systemcalls and library-functions are thread-safe.   Consult your manual
for details.

If you are  using SWI-Prolog as an  embedded engine in a  multi-threaded
application you  can access the Prolog  engine from multiple threads  by
creating an _e_n_g_i_n_e in  each thread from which you call Prolog.   Without
creating an engine, a thread can only use functions that  do not use the
term_t type (for example PL_new_atom()).

    Returns  the integer Prolog  identifier of the  engine or -1 if  the
    calling  thread  has  no Prolog  engine.    This  function  is  also
    provided  in the  single-threaded version  of  SWI-Prolog, where  it
    returns -2.

    Creates  a new Prolog engine in the calling thread.  If  the calling
    thread  already has an engine the  reference count of the engine  is
    incremented.  The  _a_t_t_r argument can be NULL to create a thread with
    default  attributes.  Otherwise it is a pointer to a  structure with
    the definition below.   For any field with value `0', the default is
    used.

    typedef struct
    { unsigned long     local_size;    /* Stack sizes (K-bytes) */
      unsigned long     global_size;
      unsigned long     trail_size;
      unsigned long     argument_size;
      char *            alias;         /* alias name */
    } PL_thread_attr_t;

    The  structure may be  destroyed after PL_thread_attach_engine() has
    returned.   If an error occurs,  -1 is returned.  If this  Prolog is
    not compiled for multi-threading, -2 is returned.


int PPLL__tthhrreeaadd__ddeessttrrooyy__eennggiinnee()
    Destroy  the  Prolog engine  in  the calling  thread.    Only  takes
    effect  if  PL_thread_destroy_engine() is called  as many  times  as
    PL_thread_attach_engine() in this thread.   Returns TRUE on  success
    and  FALSE if the calling thread  has no engine or this Prolog  does
    not support threads.

    Please  note  that  construction  and  destruction  of  engines  are
    relatively  expensive  operations.     Only  destroy  an  engine  if
    performance  is  not critical  and memory  is  a critical  resource.
    The  engine  is  automatically  destroyed if  the  thread  finishes,
    regardless how many times PL_thread_attach_engine() has been called.

In some  applications it is  useful to store  and retreive Prolog  terms
from C-code.  For example, the XPCE graphical  environment does this for
storing arbitrary Prolog data as slot-data of XPCE objects.

Please note  that the  returned handles  have no meaning  at the  Prolog
level  and  the recorded  terms  are  not  visible from  Prolog.     The
functions PL_recorded() and PL_erase() are  the only functions that  can
operate on the stored term.

Two groups  of functions are  provided.The first group  (PL_record() and
friends) store Prolog terms on the Prolog heap for  retrieval during the
same session.   These functions are also used by recorda/3  and friends.
The recorded  database may be used  to communicate Prolog terms  between
threads.


record_t PPLL__rreeccoorrdd(_t_e_r_m___t _+_t)
    Record  the term _t into the Prolog database as recorda/3  and return
    an  opaque handle to  the term.   The returned handle remains  valid
    until  PL_erase() is called on  it.   PL_recorded() is used to  copy
    recorded terms back to the Prolog stack.


void PPLL__rreeccoorrddeedd(_r_e_c_o_r_d___t _r_e_c_o_r_d_, _t_e_r_m___t _-_t)
    Copy a recorded term  back to the Prolog stack.  The same record may
    be used to copy  multiple instances at any time to the Prolog stack.
    See also PL_record() and PL_erase().


void PPLL__eerraassee(_r_e_c_o_r_d___t _r_e_c_o_r_d)
    Remove  the recorded term from  the Prolog database, reclaiming  all
    associated memory resources.

The  second group  (headed  by PL_record_external()) provides  the  same
functionality, but the returned data has properties  that enable storing
the  data on  an external  device.   It  has been  designed  to make  it
possible to store Prolog terms fast an compact in  an external database.
Here are the main features:

  o _I_n_d_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_t _o_f _s_e_s_s_i_o_n
    Records  can  be communicated  to another  Prolog  session and  made
    visible using PL_recorded_external().

  o _B_i_n_a_r_y
    The representation is  binary for maximum performance.  The returned
    data may contain 0-bytes.

  o _B_y_t_e_-_o_r_d_e_r _i_n_d_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_t
    The   representation  can  be  transferred  between   machines  with
    different byte-order.

  o _N_o _a_l_i_g_n_m_e_n_t _r_e_s_t_r_i_c_t_i_o_n_s
    There are no  memory alignment restrictions and copies of the record
    can  thus be  moved freely.    For example,  it is  possible to  use
    this  representation to exchange  terms using shared memory  between
    different Prolog processes.

  o _C_o_m_p_a_c_t
    It  is  assumed  that a  smaller  memory footprint  will  eventually
    outperform slightly faster representations.

  o _S_t_a_b_l_e
    The  format is  designed  for future  enhancements without  breaking
    compatibility with older records.

    Record  the term _t into the Prolog database as recorda/3  and return
    an  opaque handle to  the term.   The returned handle remains  valid
    until PL_erase() is called on it.

    It  is allowed  to copy the  data and use  PL_recorded_external() on
    the  copy.   The user  is responsible for  the memory management  of
    the  copy.    After copying,  the original  may  be discarded  using
    PL_erase_external().

    PL_recorded_external() is used to  copy such recorded terms back  to
    the Prolog stack.

SWI-Prolog offers both  a C and Prolog  interface to deal with  software
interrupts (signals).   The Prolog mapping  is defined in section  3.10.
This subsection deals with handling signals from C.

If a signal is not  used by Prolog and the handler does not  call Prolog
in any way, the native signal interface routines may be used.

Some versions of SWI-Prolog, notably running on  popular Unix platforms,
handle SIG_SEGV  for guarding  the Prolog stacks.    If the  application
whishes to handle this signal too,  it should use PL_signal() to install
its handler after initialisating Prolog.   SWI-Prolog will pass SIG_SEGV
to the user  code if it detected the  signal is not related to a  Prolog
stack overflow.

Any handler that  wishes to call one  of the Prolog interface  functions
should call PL_signal() for its installation.


void (*)() PPLL__ssiiggnnaall(_s_i_g_, _f_u_n_c)
    This  function  is equivalent  to  the BSD-Unix  signal()  function,
    regardless  of the  platform used.   The  signal handler is  blocked
    while  the signal routine  is active, and automatically  reactivated
    after the handler returns.

    After  a  signal handler  is  registered using  this  function,  the
    native  signal interface  redirects the signal  to a generic  signal
    handler  inside  SWI-Prolog.   This  generic  handler validates  the
    environment,   creates  a  suitable  environment  for   calling  the
    interface functions described  in this chapter and finally calls the
    registered user-handler.

PL_warning() prints a  standard Prolog warning  message to the  standard

    Register  foreign  predicates from  a  table of  structures.    This
    is  an alternative  to multiple  calls to  PL_register_foreign() and
    simplifies  code that wishes  to use  PL_register_extensions()as  an
    alternative.  The type PL_extension is defined as:

    typedef struct _PL_extension
    { char          *predicate_name; /* Name of the predicate */
      short         arity;           /* Arity of the predicate */

    The      function      PL_register_extensions()      behaves      as
    PL_load_extensions(),  but  is  the  only  PL_*  function  that  may
    be  called bbeeffoorree  PL_initialise().    The predicates are  registered

    Register    a   hook   with   the   atom-garbage    collector   (see
    garbage_collect_atoms/0  that  is   called  on  any  atom  that   is
    reclaimed.    The old hook  is returned.   If  no hook is  currently

This section  provides some hints for  handling foreign data in  Prolog.
With foreign  data, we refer  to data that is  used by foreign  language
predicates  and  needs  to  be passed  around  in  Prolog.     Excluding
combinations, there are three principal options for storing such data

  o _N_a_t_u_r_a_l _P_r_o_l_o_g _d_a_t_a
    E.i.  using the  representation  one would  choose if  there was  no
    foreign interface required.

  o _O_p_a_q_u_e _p_a_c_k_e_d _P_r_o_l_o_g _d_a_t_a
    Data can also  be represetented in a foreign structure and stored on
    the  Prolog stacks using  PL_put_string_nchars()and retrieved  using
    PL_get_string_chars().   It is generally good  practice to wrap  the
    string  in a compound term with arity 1, so Prolog can  identify the
    type.    portray/1 rules  may be  used to  streamline printing  such
    terms during development.

  o _N_a_t_u_r_a_l _f_o_r_e_i_g_n _d_a_t_a_, _p_a_s_s_i_n_g _a _p_o_i_n_t_e_r
    An  alternative is to pass  a pointer to the  foreign data.   Again,
    this functor may be wrapped in a compound term.

The choice may be guided using the following distinctions

  o _I_s _t_h_e _d_a_t_a _o_p_a_q_u_e _t_o _P_r_o_l_o_g
    With  `opaque' data, we refer to data handled in  foreign functions,
    passed  around in  Prolog, but  of which Prolog  never examines  the
    contents  of the  data itself.   If  the data is  opaque to  Prolog,
    the  choosen representation  does not depend  on simple analysis  by
    Prolog,  and the selection  will be driven  solely by simplicity  of
    the interface and performance (both in time and space).

  o _H_o_w _b_i_g _i_s _t_h_e _d_a_t_a
    Is  effient encoding  required?   For  examine, a  boolean aray  may
    be  expressed as  a compound  term, holding integers  each of  which
    contains a number of bits, or as a list of true and false.

  o _W_h_a_t _i_s _t_h_e _n_a_t_u_r_e _o_f _t_h_e _d_a_t_a
    For  examples in C,  constants are often  expressed using `enum'  or
    #define'd  integer values.   If  prolog needs  to handle this  data,
    atoms  are a more logical  choice.  Whether  or not this mapping  is
    used  depends on  whether Prolog  needs to interpret  the data,  how
    important debugging is and how important performance is.

  o _W_h_a_t _i_s _t_h_e _l_i_f_e_t_i_m_e _o_f _t_h_e _d_a_t_a
    We can distinguish three cases.

     1.  The lifetime  is dictated by  the accesibility  of the data  on
         the Prolog stacks.   Their is no way by which the  foreign code
         when the  data becomes `garbage',  and the  data thus needs  to
         be represented  on the Prolog  stacks using Prolog  data-types.
         (2),

     2.  The  data lives  on  the  `heap' and  is  explicitly  allocated
         and deallocated.   In  this case,  representing the data  using
         native foreign representation and passing a pointer to  it is a
         sensible choice.

     3.  The data lives as  during the lifetime of a  foreign predicate.
         If the predicate is deterministic, foreign  automatic variables
         are suitable.  if the predicate is  non-deterministic, the data
         may be allocated  using malloc() and  a pointer may be  passed.
         See section 5.6.1.1.

In this section, we wull outline some examples,  covering typical cases.
In  the  first  example,  we will  deal  with  extending  Prolog's  data
representation with  integer-sets, represented as  bit-vectors.  In  the
second example, we  look at handling a  `netmask'.  Finally, we  discuss
the outline of the DDE interface.

IInntteeggeerr  sseettss with  not-to-far-apart  upper-  and  lower-bounds  can  be
represented using  bit-vectors.  Common  set operations, such as  union,
intersection,  etc.    are  reduced to  simple  and'ing and  or'ing  the
bitvectors.    This  can  be  done  in Prolog,  using  a  compound  term
holding  integer  arguments.    Especially  if  the  integers  are  kept
below  the maximum  tagged  integer  value (see  current_prolog_flag/2),
this representation  is fairly space-efficient (wasting  1 word for  the
functor and and  7 bits per integer for  the tags).  Arithmetic can  all
be performed in Prolog too.

For really demanding  applications, foreign representation will  perform
better,  especially  time-wise.    Bit-vectors are  natrually  expressed
using  string  objects.    If  the  string is  wrapped  in  bitvector/1,
lower-bound of the  vector is 0, and  the upperbound is not defined,  an
implementation for getting  and putting the setes  as well as the  union
predicate for it is below.

#include <SWI-Prolog.h>

#define max(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
#define min(a, b) ((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b))

static functor_t FUNCTOR_bitvector1;

get_bitvector(term_t in, int *len, unsigned char **data)

  { term_t a = PL_new_term_ref();

    return PL_get_string(a, (char **)data, len);
  }

  PL_fail;

  { term_t a = PL_new_term_ref();

    PL_get_arg(1, out, a);

    return PL_unify_string_nchars(a, len, (const char *)data);
  }

  PL_fail;

       get_bitvector(t2, &l2, &s2) )
  { int l = max(l1, l2);
    unsigned char *s3 = alloca(l);

    if ( s3 )
    { int n;
      int ml = min(l1, l2);

      for(n=0; n<ml; n++)
        s3[n] = s1[n] | s2[n];
      for( ; n < l1; n++)
        s3[n] = s1[n];
      for( ; n < l2; n++)
        s3[n] = s2[n];

      return unify_bitvector(u, l, s3);
    }

    return PL_warning("Not enough memory");
  }

  PL_fail;
}

install_t

NNeettmmaasskk''ss are  used with  TCP/IP  configuration.    Suppose we  have  an
application dealing with reasoning about a network configuration.   Such
an  application  requires  communicating  netmask  structures  from  the
operating system,  reasoning about  them and  possibly communicate  them
to the  user.   A  netmask consists  of 4  bitmasks between  0 and  255.
C-application  normally see  them as  an 4-byte  wide unsigned  integer.
SWI-Prolog cannot do that, as integers are always signed.

We could use the string approach outlined above, but  this makes it hard
to handle  these terms in Prolog.   A better  choice is a compound  term
netmask/4, holding the 4 submasks as integer arguments.

As the implementation is trivial, we will omit this here.

TThhee DDDDEE  iinntteerrffaaccee (see section  3.46) represents  another common  usage
of  the foreign  interface:   providing communication  to new  operating
system features.  The DDE interface requires knowledge  about active DDE
server and  client channels.   These  channels contains various  foreign
data-types.  Such an interface is normally achieved  using an open/close
protocol that creates and destroys a _h_a_n_d_l_e.  The  handle is a reference
to a foreign data-structure containing the relevant information.

There are a  couple of possibilities for  representing the handle.   The
choice  depends on  responsibilities  and  debugging facilities.     The
simplest  aproach is  to using  PL_unify_pointer() and PL_get_pointer().
This  approach is  fast and  easy, but  has the  drawbacks of  (untyped)
pointers:   there  is no  reliable way  to detect  the  validity of  the
pointer, not  to verify  it is pointing  to a  structure of the  desired
type.   The pointer  may be wrapped  into a compound  term with arity  1
(i.e.  dde_channel(<_P_o_i_n_t_e_r>)), making the type-problem less serious.

Alternatively  (used in  the  DDE  interface),  the interface  code  can
maintain a  (preferably variable  length) array of  pointers and  return
the index in this  array.  This provides better protection.   Especially
for debugging  purposes, wrapping  the handle  in a compound  is a  good
suggestion.

As  of  version  2.1.0,  SWI-Prolog may  be  embedded  in  a  C-program.
To  reach  at  a compiled  C-program  with  SWI-Prolog  as  an  embedded
application is very  similar to creating a statically linked  SWI-Prolog
executable as described in section 5.4.1.

The  file  \ldots/pl/include/stub.c  defines  SWI-Prologs  default  main
program:

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{ if ( !PL_initialise(argc, argv) )
    PL_halt(1);

  PL_install_readline();        /* delete if you don't want readline */

  PL_halt(PL_toplevel() ? 0 : 1);
}

This  may be  replaced with  your own  main C-program.    The  interface
function  PL_initialise()  mmuusstt  be  called  before  any  of  the  other
SWI-Prolog  foreign  language  functions  described  in   this  chapter.
PL_initialise() interprets  all the command-line  arguments, except  for
the -t toplevel flag that is interpreted by PL_toplevel().


int PPLL__iinniittiiaalliissee(_i_n_t _a_r_g_c_, _c_h_a_r _*_*_a_r_g_v)
    Initialises  the SWI-Prolog heap and  stacks, restores the boot  QLF
    file,  loads the system and personal initialisation files,  runs the
    at_initialization/1 hooks and finally runs the -g goal hook.

    Special  consideration  is required  for argv[0].    On  UUnniixx,  this
    argument  passes the part of the commandline that is used  to locate
    the  executable.   Prolog  uses this to  find the  file holding  the
    running executable.   The WWiinnddoowwss version uses this to find a _m_o_d_u_l_e
    of  the  running executable.    If the  specified  module cannot  be
    found, it tries  the module libpl.dll, containing the Prolog runtime
    kernel.   In  all these cases,  the resulting file  is used for  two
    purposes

      o  See whether a Prolog saved-state  is appended to the file.   If
         this is  the case,  this state  will be loaded  instead of  the
         default boot.prc file from the SWI-Prolog home directory.   See
         also qsave_program/[1,2] and section 5.7.

      o  Find the Prolog home  directory.  This process is  described in
         detail in section 5.8.

    PL_initialise()  returns 1  if all  initialisation  succeeded and  0
    otherwise.

    In  most cases, _a_r_g_c and _a_r_g_v will be passed from the  main program.
    It  is allowed to create your own argument vector,  provided argv[0]
    is constructed according to the rules above.  For example:

    int
    main(int argc, char **argv)
    { char *av[10];
      int ac = 0;

      av[ac++] = argv[0];
      av[ac++] = "-x";
      av[ac++] = "mystate";
      av[ac]   = NULL;

      if ( !PL_initialise(ac, av) )
        PL_halt(1);
      ...
    }

    Please  note that the  passed argument vector  may be referred  from
    Prolog  at any time  and should  therefore be valid  as long as  the
    Prolog engine is used.

    A  good setup  in Windows is  to add  SWI-Prolog's bin directory  to
    your  PATH  and  either pass  a  module holding  a  saved-state,  or
    "libpl.dll" as argv[0].

    Test  whether the  Prolog engine  is already initialised.    Returns
    FALSE  if Prolog  is not  initialised and TRUE  otherwise.   If  the
    engine is initialised  and _a_r_g_c is not NULL, the argument count used
    with  PL_initialise() is  stored in  _a_r_g_c.   Same  for the  argument
    vector _a_r_g_v.


void PPLL__iinnssttaallll__rreeaaddlliinnee()
    Installs  the GNU-readline line-editor.  Embedded  applications that
    do  not use the  Prolog toplevel should  normally delete this  line,
    shrinking the Prolog kernel significantly.


int PPLL__ttoopplleevveell()
    Runs  the  goal of  the -t toplevel  switch  (default prolog/0)  and
    returns 1 if successful, 0 otherwise.


void PPLL__cclleeaannuupp(_i_n_t _s_t_a_t_u_s)
    This  function performs  the reverse  of PL_initialise().   It  runs
    the  PL_on_halt()and at_halt/1 handlers, closes all  streams (except
    for the `standard  I/O' streams which are flushed only), deallocates
    all  memory and restores all signal  handlers.  The _s_t_a_t_u_s  argument
    is  passed  to  the  various termination  hooks  and  indicates  the
    _e_x_i_t_-_s_t_a_t_u_s.

    This  function allows deleting and  restarting the Prolog system  in
    the same  process.  Use it with care, as PL_initialise() is a costly
    function.   Unix  users should consider  using exec() (available  as
    part of the clib package,).


void PPLL__hhaalltt(_i_n_t _s_t_a_t_u_s)
    Cleanup  the Prolog environment using PL_cleanup() and calls  exit()
    with the status argument.

The  utility program  plld (Win32:   plld.exe)  may be  used  to link  a
combination of C-files  and Prolog files into a stand-alone  executable.
plld automates most of what is described in the previous sections.

In the normal  usage, a copy is  made of the default embedding  template
\ldots/pl/include/stub.c.    The  main()  routine is  modified  to  suit
your  application.    PL_initialise() mmuusstt  be passed  the  program-name
(_a_r_g_v_[_0_])  (Win32:    the  executing  program  can   be  obtained  using
GetModuleFileName()).   The other  elements of  the command-line may  be
modified.  Next, plld is typically invoked as:

plld -o output stubfile.c [other-c-or-o-files] [plfiles]

plld  will first  split the  options into  various groups  for both  the
C-compiler and the Prolog  compiler.  Next, it will add  various default
options to the  C-compiler and call it  to create an executable  holding
the  user's C-code  and the  Prolog kernel.    Then,  it  will call  the
SWI-Prolog compiler  to create a  saved state  from the provided  Prolog
files  and finally,  it  will attach  this saved  state to  the  created
emulator to create the requested executable.

Below, it  is described how the options  are split and which  additional
options are passed.

--hheellpp
    Print brief synopsis.

--ppll _p_r_o_l_o_g
    Select  the prolog to use.   This prolog  is used for two  purposes:
    get  the home-directory as well  as the compiler/linker options  and
    create a saved state of the Prolog code.

--lldd _l_i_n_k_e_r
    Linker  used to  link the raw  executable.   Default is  to use  the
    C-compiler (Win32:  link.exe).

--cccc _C_-_c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r
    Compiler  for  .c  files found  on  the  commandline.    Default  is
    the  compiler used  to build SWI-Prolog  (see current_prolog_flag/2)
    (Win32:  cl.exe).

--cc++++ _C_+_+_-_c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r
    Compiler  for C++ sources (extensions  .cpp, .cxx, .cc or .C)  files
    found  on the commandline.  Default is c++ or g++ if  the C-compiler
    is gcc) (Win32:  cl.exe).

--nnoossttaattee
    Just  relink  the  kernel,  do  not  add  any  Prolog  code  to  the
    new  kernel.     This  is  used  to  create  a  new  kernel  holding
    additional  foreign predicates on machines  that do not support  the
    shared-library  (DLL) interface, or if building the state  cannot be
    handled  by the default procedure used by plld.  In the  latter case
    the  state is created  seperately and appended  to the kernel  using
    cat <_k_e_r_n_e_l> <_s_t_a_t_e> > <_o_u_t>(Win32:  copy /b <_k_e_r_n_e_l>+<_s_t_a_t_e> <_o_u_t>)

--ppll--ooppttiioonnss _,_._._.
    Additional  options passed to Prolog when creating the  saved state.
    The  first character  immediately  following pl-options  is used  as
    separator  and  translated to  spaces when  the  argument is  built.
    Example:  -pl-options,-F,xpce  passed -F xpce as additional flags to
    Prolog.

--lldd--ooppttiioonnss _,_._._.
    Passes options to the linker, similar to -pl-options.

--cccc--ooppttiioonnss _,_._._.
    Passes options to the C/C++ compiler, similar to -pl-options.

--vv
    Select  verbose operation,  showing the  various programs and  their
    options.

--oo _o_u_t_f_i_l_e
    Reserved to specify the final output file.

--ll_l_i_b_r_a_r_y
    Specifies  a library for the C-compiler.   By default, -lpl  (Win32:
    libpl.lib) and the libraries needed by the Prolog kernel are given.

--LL_l_i_b_r_a_r_y_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
    Specifies  a  library directory  for  the C-compiler.    By  default
    the  directory  containing  the  Prolog C-library  for  the  current
    architecture is passed.

-g | -Iinclude-directory | -Ddefinition
    These  options  are passed  to  the C-compiler.    By  default,  the
    include directory containing SWI-Prolog.h  is passed.  plld adds two
    additional * -Ddef flags:

    --DD____SWI_PROLOG__
         Indicates the code is to be connected to SWI-Prolog.

    --DD____SWI_EMBEDDED__
         Indicates the creation of an embedded program.

 _*_._o | _*_._c | _*_._C | _*_._c_x_x | _*_._c_p_p
    Passed as input files to the C-compiler

 _*_._p_l |_*_._q_l_f
    Passed  as  input  files  to  the  Prolog  compiler  to  create  the
    saved-state.

 *
    I.e.  all other options.  These are passed as linker options  to the
    C-compiler.

The  following is  a very  simple example  going through  all the  steps
outlined above.   It  provides an arithmetic expression  evaluator.   We
will call  the application calc  and define it in  the files calc.c  and
calc.pl.  The Prolog file is simple:

calc(Atom) :-
        term_to_atom(Expr, Atom),
        A is Expr,
        write(A),
        nl.

The  C-part  of   the  application  parses  the  command-line   options,
initialises the  Prolog engine, locates  the calc/1 predicate and  calls
it.  The coder is in figure 5.5.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <SWI-Prolog.h>

#define MAXLINE 1024

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{ char expression[MAXLINE];
  char *e = expression;
  char *program = argv[0];
  char *plav[2];
  int n;

  /* combine all the arguments in a single string */

  for(n=1; n<argc; n++)
  { if ( n != 1 )
      *e++ = ' ';
    strcpy(e, argv[n]);
    e += strlen(e);

  }

  /* make the argument vector for Prolog */

  plav[0] = program;
  plav[1] = NULL;

  /* initialise Prolog */

  if ( !PL_initialise(1, plav) )
    PL_halt(1);

  /* Lookup calc/1 and make the arguments and call */

  { predicate_t pred = PL_predicate("calc", 1, "user");

    term_t h0 = PL_new_term_refs(1);
    int rval;

    PL_put_atom_chars(h0, expression);
    rval = PL_call_predicate(NULL, PL_Q_NORMAL, pred, h0);

    PL_halt(rval ? 0 : 1);
  }

  return 0;
}

             Figure 5.5:  C-source for the calc application

The application is now created using the following command-line:

% plld -o calc calc.c calc.pl

The following indicates the usage of the application:

Executables  embedding SWI-Prolog  should  be able  to find  the  `home'
directory  of  the  development  environment  unless   a  self-contained
saved-state has  been added to  the executable  (see qsave_program/[1,2]
and section 5.7).

If Prolog starts up, it will try to  locate the development environment.
To do so, it will try the following steps until one succeeds.

 1. If  the environment variable  SWI_HOME_DIRis  defined and points  to
    an existing directory, use this.

 2. If  the  environment variable  SWIPL  is defined  and points  to  an
    existing directory, use this.

 3. Locate  the  primary   executable  or  (Windows  only)  a  component
    (_m_o_d_u_l_e)  thereof  and check  whether the  parent  directory of  the
    directory  holding this file contains the  file swipl.  If so,  this
    file  contains the (relative) path to  the home directory.  If  this
    directory  exists, use this.   This is the normal mechanism  used by
    the binary distribution.

 4. If  the precompiled path exists, use it.  This is only  useful for a
    source installation.

If  all fails  and  there is  no state  attached  to the  executable  or
provided Windows module (see PL_initialise()), SWI-Prolog gives up.   If
a state is attached, the current working directory is used.

The file_search_path/2 alias swi is set  to point to the home  directory
located.

SWI-Prolog's  memory  allocation  is  based  on  the  malloc(3)  library
routines.   Foreign  applications can safely  use malloc(3),  realloc(3)
and free(3).   Memory allocation using brk(2) or sbrk(2) is  not allowed
as these calls conflict with malloc(3).

normally.     Most  modern  environments  provide  debugging  tools  for

In  the  current  version  of the  system  all  public  C  functions  of
SWI-Prolog are in the symbol table.  This can lead  to name clashes with
foreign code.    Someday I  should write a  program to  strip all  these
symbols from the symbol table  (why does Unix not have that?).   For now
I can only suggest to give your function another name.   You can do this
using the C preprocessor.  If---for example---your  foreign package uses
a function warning(), which happens to exist in SWI-Prolog  as well, the
following macro should fix the problem.

#define warning warning_

Note  that shared  libraries do  not  have this  problem as  the  shared
library loader  will only look  for symbols in  the main executable  for
symbols that are not defined in the library itself.

The term-reference  mechanism was first used  by Quintus Prolog  version
3.     SICStus  Prolog version  3  is  strongly  based  on  the  Quintus
interface.  The  described SWI-Prolog interface is similar to  using the
Quintus or SICStus interfaces, defining all  foreign-predicate arguments
of  type  +term.    SWI-Prolog  explicitly uses  type  functor_t,  while
Quintus  and SICStus  uses <_n_a_m_e>  and  <_a_r_i_t_y>.   As  the  names of  the
functions differ  from Prolog to  Prolog, a  simple macro layer  dealing
with the names can also deal with this detail.  For example:

#define QP_put_functor(t, n, a) PL_put_functor(t, PL_new_functor(n, a))

The  PL_unify_*()  functions are  lacking from  the  Quintus and  SICStus
interface.    They can  easily  be emulated  or the  put/unify  approach
should be used to write compatible code.

The PL_open_foreign_frame()/PL_close_foreign_frame() combination is lack-
ing from both other  Prologs.  SICStus has PL_new_term_refs(_0),  followed
by PL_reset_term_refs()that allows for discarding term references.

The  Prolog interface  for  the graphical  user interface  package  XPCE
shares about  90% of the code  using a simple  macro layer to deal  with
different naming and calling conventions of the interfaces.

This  chapter  describes  the  features  of  SWI-Prolog  for  delivering
applications that can run without the development version  of the system
installed.

A SWI-Prolog runtime executable is a file consisting of two  parts.  The
first part  is the  _e_m_u_l_a_t_o_r, which is  machine dependent.   The  second
part is the _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e  _a_r_c_h_i_v_e, which contains the compiled program  in a
machine-independent format,  startup options  and possibly  user-defined
_r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s, see resource/3 and open_resource/3.

These two parts  can be connected in various  different ways.  The  most
common way  for distributed runtime applications  is to _c_o_n_c_a_t_e_n_a_t_e  the
two parts.   This can be achieved  using external commands (Unix:   cat,
Windows:   copy), or  using the  stand_alone option  to qsave_program/2.
The  second option  is  to  attach a  startup  script  in front  of  the
resource that  starts the  emulator with the  proper options.   This  is
the default  under Unix.   Finally,  an emulator  can be told  to use  a
specified resource file using the -x commandline switch.


qqssaavvee__pprrooggrraamm((_+_F_i_l_e_, _+_L_i_s_t_O_f_O_p_t_i_o_n_s))
    Saves   the  current  state  of  the  program  to  the   file  _F_i_l_e.
    The  result  is a  resource archive  containing  a saved-state  that
    expresses  all  Prolog   data  from  the  running  program  and  all
    user-defined  resources.   Depending on the stand_alone option,  the
    resource is headed by the emulator, a Unix shell-script or nothing.

    _L_i_s_t_O_f_O_p_t_i_o_n_s  is a  list of  <_K_e_y>=<_V_a_l_u_e> or  <_K_e_y>(<_V_a_l_u_e>)  pairs.
    The available keys are described in table 6.1.

          Table 6.1:  <_K_e_y> = <_V_a_l_u_e> pairs for qsave_program/2

    Before   writing  the  data   to  file,  qsave_program/2  will   run
    autoload/0  to all  required  autoloading the  system can  discover.
    See autoload/0.

    Provided  the  application  does  not  require  any  of  the  Prolog
    libraries  to  be  loaded  at  runtime,   the  only  file  from  the
    SWI-Prolog development  environment required is the emulator itself.
    The  emulator may  be built in  two flavours.   The  default is  the
    _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t  _e_m_u_l_a_t_o_r.  The  _r_u_n_t_i_m_e _e_m_u_l_a_t_o_r is similar, but  lacks
    the tracer.

    If the  option stand_alone(on)is present, the  emulator is the first
    part of the state.   If the emulator is started it will test whether
    a  boot-file (state)  is attached  to the emulator  itself and  load
    this  state.   Provided  the application has  all libraries  loaded,
    the  resulting executable is  completely independent of the  runtime
    environment or location where it was build.

    See also section 2.10.2.4.

    Check  the current Prolog program  for predicates that are  referred
    to,  are  undefined and  have a  definition in  the Prolog  library.
    Load the appropriate libraries.

    This  predicate is used  by qsave_program/[1,2] to ensure the  saved
    state  will not  depend  on one  of the  libraries.   The  predicate
    autoload/0  will find all ddiirreecctt references to predicates.   It does
    not  find predicates referenced via meta-predicates.   The predicate
    log/2  is  defined  in the  library(quintus)  to provide  a  quintus
    compatible means to compute  the natural logarithm of a number.  The
    following program will  behave correctly if its state is executed in
    an environment where the library(quintus) is not available:

    logtable(From, To) :-
            From > To, !.
    logtable(From, To) :-
            log(From, Value),
            format('~d~t~8|~2f~n', [From, Value]),
            F is From + 1,
            logtable(F, To).

    However,  the following implementation  refers to log/2 through  the
    meta-predicate  maplist/3.   Autoload will not  be able to find  the
    reference.   This problem may be fixed either by loading  the module
    libtary(quintus)  explicitly or  use  require/1 to  tell the  system
    that the predicate log/2 is required by this module.

    logtable(From, To) :-

    Declare  that  the clauses  of specified  predicates  should nnoott  be

    to avoid that  the clauses of dynamic predicates that represent data

There  are  three  areas  that  require  special  attention  when  using
qsave_program/[1,2].

  o If  the  program  is an  embedded  Prolog  application or  uses  the
    foreign  language interface,  care has  to be taken  to restore  the
    appropriate foreign context.  See section 6.2 for details.

  o If  the program uses directives (:- goal. lines) that  perform other
    actions then  setting predicate attributes (dynamic, volatile, etc.)
    or  loading files  (consult,  etc.), the  directive may  need to  be
    prefixed with initialization/1.

  o Database  references as returned by clause/3, recorded/3, etc.   are
    not preserved and may thus not be part of the database when saved.

Some  applications may  need  to  use the  foreign  language  interface.
Object code is  by definition machine-dependent and thus cannot  be part
of the saved program file.

To complicate the matter even further there are various  ways of loading
foreign code:

  o _U_s_i_n_g _t_h_e _l_i_b_r_a_r_y_(_s_h_l_i_b_) _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_s
    This  is the preferred way of dealing  with foreign code.   It loads
    quickly and ensures  an acceptable level of independence between the
    versions  of the emulator and the foreign code loaded.  It  works on
    Unix  machines supporting shared libraries and library  functions to
    load  them.  Most  modern Unixes, as  well as Win32 (Windows  95/NT)
    satisfy this constraint.

  o _S_t_a_t_i_c _l_i_n_k_i_n_g
    This  mechanism works on  all machines,  but generally requires  the
    same  C-compiler and linker to be  used for the external code as  is
    used to build SWI-Prolog itself.

To make  a runtime  executable that  can run on  multiple platforms  one
must make runtime  checks to find the correct  way of linking.   Suppose
we have  a source-file  myextension defining  the installation  function
install().

If this file  is compiled into a  shared library, load_foreign_library/1
will load this library and call the installation  function to initialise
the  foreign code.    If it  is  loaded as  a static  extension,  define
install() as the predicate install/0:

static foreign_t
pl_install()
{ install();

  PL_succeed;
}

PL_extension PL_extensions [] =
{
/*{ "name",     arity,  function,       PL_FA_<flags> },*/

  { "install",  0,      pl_install,     0 },
  { NULL,       0,      NULL,           0 }     /* terminating line */
};

Now, use the following Prolog code to load the foreign library:

load_foreign_extensions :-
        current_predicate(install, install), !, % static loaded
        install.
load_foreign_extensions :-                      % shared library
        load_foreign_library(foreign(myextension)).

:- initialization load_foreign_extensions.

The path  alias foreign  is defined by  file_search_path/2.   By  default
it  searches  the  directories <_h_o_m_e>/lib/<_a_r_c_h> and  <_h_o_m_e>/lib.     The
application can specify additional rules for file_search_path/2.

A  _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e is  very  similar to  a  file.    Resources however  can  be
represented in two different formats:  on files, as well  as part of the
resource _a_r_c_h_i_v_e of a saved-state (see qsave_program/2).

A resource has a _n_a_m_e  and a _c_l_a_s_s.  The _s_o_u_r_c_e data of the  resource is
a file.   Resources are declared by declaring the  predicate resource/3.
They are accessed using the predicate open_resource/3.

Before  going into  details,  let  us start  with  an  example.    Short
texts  can easily  be expressed  in Prolog  sourcecode,  but long  texts
are cumbersome.   Assume our application  defines a command `help'  that
prints a  helptext to the screen.   We put  the content of the  helptext
into a  file called help.txt.   The following  code implements our  help
command such that help.txt is incorperated into the runtime executable.

resource(help, text, 'help.txt').

help :-
        open_resource(help, text, In),
        copy_stream(In, user_output),
        close(In).

copy_stream(In, Out) :-
        get0(In, C),
        copy_stream(C, In, Out).

copy_stream(-1, _, _) :- !.
copy_stream(C, In, Out) :-
        put(Out, C),
        get0(In, C2),
        copy_stream(C2, In, Out).

The predicate  help/0 opens  the resource  as a Prolog  stream.   If  we
are executing this from the development environment,  this will actually
return  a stream  to  the  gelp.txt itself.     When executed  from  the
saved-state, the stream will actually be a stream  opened on the program
resource file, taking care of the offset and length of the resource.

    This  predicate is  defined  as a  dynamic predicate  in the  module
    user.    Clauses for  it may  be  defined in  any module,  including
    the  user module.    _N_a_m_e is  the name  of the  resource (an  atom).
    A  resource name  may contain  any character,  except for  $ and  :,
    which  are  reserved for  internal usage  by  the resource  library.
    _C_l_a_s_s  describes the what kind of object is stored in  the resource.
    In  the  current implementation,  it  is just  an  atom.    _F_i_l_e_S_p_e_c
    is  a file  specification that  may exploit  file_search_path/2 (see
    absolute_file_name/2).

    Normally,  resources are  defined as unit  clauses (facts), but  the
    definition  of this  predicate also allows  for rules.   For  proper
    generation  of the  saved state,  it must be  possible to  enumerate
    the  available  resources by  calling this  predicate  with all  its
    arguments unbound.

    Dynamic  rules are useful to turn  all files in a certain  directory
    into  resources, without specifying a resources for each file.   For
    example,  assume the file_search_path/2icons refers to  the resource
    directory  containing icon-files.   The  following definition  makes
    all these images available as resources:

    resource(Name, image, icons(XpmName)) :-
            atom(Name), !,
            file_name_extension(Name, xpm, XpmName).
    resource(Name, image, XpmFile) :-
            var(Name),
            absolute_file_name(icons(.), [type(directory)], Dir)
            concat(Dir, '/*.xpm', Pattern),
            expand_file_name(Pattern, XpmFiles),
            member(XpmFile, XpmFiles).


ooppeenn__rreessoouurrccee((_+_N_a_m_e_, _?_C_l_a_s_s_, _-_S_t_r_e_a_m))
    Opens  the resource specified by _N_a_m_e and  _C_l_a_s_s.  If the  latter is
    a  variable, it will be unified  to the class of the  first resource
    found that has the  specified _N_a_m_e.  If successful, _S_t_r_e_a_m becomes a
    handle to a  binary input stream, providing access to the content of
    the resource.

    The  predicate  open_resource/3  first  checks  resource/3.     When
    succesful   it  will   open  the   returned  resource   source-file.
    Otherwise  it will  look in the  programs resource  database.   When
    creating  a  saved-state,  the system  normally saves  the  resource
    contents  into the resource archive, but does not save  the resource
    clauses.

    This   way,  the  development   environment  uses  the  files   (and
    modifications   to   the   resource/3  declarations   and/or   files
    containing  resource   info  thus  immediately  affect  the  running
    environment,  while the runtime  system quickly accesses the  system
    resources.

The  utility program  plrc can  be used  to examine  and manipulate  the
contents of  a SWI-Prolog resource  file.  The  options are inspired  by
the Unix ar program.  The basic command is:

% plrc option resource-file member ...

The options are described below.

ll
    List contents of the archive.

xx
    Extract  named (or  all)  members of  the archive  into the  current
    directory.

aa
    Add  files  to the  archive.    If the  archive already  contains  a
    member  with the  same name,  the contents  is replaced.    Anywhere
    in   the  sequence  of  members,   the  options  --class=_c_l_a_s_s   and
    --encoding=_e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g may appear.   They affect the class and encoding
    of subsequent files.  The initial class is data and encoding none.

dd
    Delete named members from the archive.

This command is also described in the pl(1) Unix manual page.

If your application  uses files that are  not part of the saved  program
such as database  files, configuration files, etc., the  runtime version
has to be able to  locate these files.  The file_search_path/2 mechanism
in combination with  the -palias command-line argument is the  preferred
way to  locate runtime  files.   The first  step is to  define an  alias
for the  toplevel directory  of your  application.   We  will call  this
directory gnatdir in our examples.

A  good  place  for storing  data  associated  with  SWI-Prolog  runtime
systems is  below the emulator's  home-directory.   swi is a  predefined
alias for this directory.  The following is  a useful default definition
for the search path.

user:file_search_path(gnatdir, swi(gnat)).

The  application  should  locate   all  files  using  absolute_file_name.
Suppose   gnatdir   contains   a  file   config.pl   to   define   local
configuration.  Then use the code below to load this file:

configure_gnat :-
        (   absolute_file_name(gnatdir('config.pl'), ConfigFile)
            ->  consult(ConfigFile)
            ;   format(user_error, 'gnat: Cannot locate config.pl~n'),
            halt(1)
            ).

Suppose   the  system   administrator  has   installed  the   SWI-Prolog
runtime  environment  in  /usr/local/lib/rt-pl-3.2.0.     A  user  wants
to  install  gnat,   but  gnat  will  look  for  its   configuration  in
/usr/local/lib/rt-pl-3.2.0/gnat where the user cannot write.

The user  decides to install the  gnat runtime files in  /users/bob/lib/
gnat.  For one-time  usage, the user may decide to start gnat  using the
command:

% gnat -p gnatdir=/users/bob/lib/gnat

The sources  may be  used to built  two versions  of the emulator.    By
default,  the _d_e_v_e_l_o_p_m_e_n_t _e_m_u_l_a_t_o_r  is built.    This emulator  contains
all features  for interactive development  of Prolog  applications.   If
the system is  configured using --enable-runtime, make(1) will  create a
_r_u_n_t_i_m_e _v_e_r_s_i_o_n  of the emulator.   This emulator  is equivalent to  the
development version, except for the following features:

  o _N_o _i_n_p_u_t _e_d_i_t_i_n_g
    The  GNU library -lreadline  that provides EMACS compatible  editing
    of input lines will not be linked to the system.

  o _N_o _t_r_a_c_e_r
    The  tracer and  all its options  are removed,  making the system  a
    little faster too.

  o _N_o _p_r_o_f_i_l_e_r
    profile/3 and friends are  not supported.  This saves some space and
    provides better performance.

  o _N_o _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t
    Keyboard  interrupt (Control-C  normally)  is not  rebound and  will
    normally terminate the application.

  o _c_u_r_r_e_n_t___p_r_o_l_o_g___f_l_a_g_(_r_u_n_t_i_m_e_, _t_r_u_e_) _s_u_c_c_e_e_d_s
    This  may  be used  to verify  your application  is  running in  the
    runtime environment rather than the development environment.

  o clause/[2,3] _d_o _n_o_t _w_o_r_k _o_n _s_t_a_t_i_c _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_s
    This  prolog-flag inhibits listing your program.  It is only  a very
    limited protection however.

The  following  fragment   is  an  example  for  building  the   runtime
environment in  \env{HOME}/lib/rt-pl-3.2.0.   If  possible, the  shared-
library interface should  be configured to ensure  it can serve a  large
number of applications.

% cd pl-3.2.0
% mkdir runtime
% cd runtime
% ../src/configure --enable-runtime --prefix=$HOME
% make
% make rt-install

The  runtime directory  contains  the components  listed  below.    This
directory may be tar'ed and shipped with your application.

This chapter documents  the SWI-Prolog library.  As  SWI-Prolog provides
auto-loading,  there is  little  difference between  library  predicates
and built-in predicates.   Part of  the library is therefore  documented
in the  rest of  the manual.   Library  predicates differ from  built-in
predicates in the following ways.

  o User-definition  of a  built-in leads to  a permission-error,  while
    using the name of a library predicate is allowed.

  o If  autoloading is disabled explicitely or because  trapping unknown
    predicates  is disabled  (see unknown/2  and current_prolog_flag/2),
    library predicates must be loaded explicitely.

  o Using  libraries reduced  the footprint of  applications that  don't
    need them.

    The  typical usage  of this  predicate is right  after loading  your

    conflicts in your program.


lliisstt__uunnddeeffiinneedd
    Scans  the  database for  predicates that  have no  definition.    A
    predicate  is  considered defined  if it  has clauses,  is  declared
    using  dynamic/1 or  multifile/1.   As a  program is compiled  calls
    are  translated to predicates.   If the called predicate is not  yet
    defined  it is created as a predicate without definition.   The same
    happens  with runtime  generated calls.   This  predicate lists  all
    such undefined predicates that  are not defined in the library.  See
    also list_autoload/0.

    Note:   undefined  predicates are never  removed from the  database.
    For  proper results  it is  therefore adviced to  run check/0  right
    after loading your program.

    Diference-list version to  read an input line to a list of character

    Open  _U_R_L in  an external  web-browser.   The reason  to place  this
    in  the library  is  to centralise  the maintenance  on this  highly
    platform  and browser specific task.   It distinguishes between  the
    following cases:

      o  _M_S_-_W_i_n_d_o_w_s
         If it detects MS-Windows  it uses win_shell/2 to open the  _U_R_L.
         The behaviour  and browser  started depends on  the Window  and
         Windows-shell configuration,  but in general  it should be  the
         behaviour expected by the user.

      o  _O_t_h_e_r _p_l_a_t_f_o_r_m_s
         On other  platforms it  assumes the browser  is netscape.    It
         first tries  to tell a  running netscape to  open the page  and
         only after this fails it starts a new browser.

The  library(registry)  is  only available  on  the  MS-Windows  version
of  SWI-Prolog.      It  loads   the  foreign  extension   plregtry.dll,
providing  the   predicates  described  below.      This  library   only
makes  the most  common  operations on  the registry  available  through
the  Prolog  user.     The  underlying  DLL  provides  a  more  complete
coverage of  the Windows  registry API.  Please consult  the sources  in
pl/src/win32/foreign/plregtry.c for further details.

In  all these  predicates,  _P_a_t_h refers  to a  `/' separated  path  into
the registry.   This  is _n_o_t an atom  containing `/'-characters as  used
for  filenames, but  a term  using the  functor  //2.   Windows  defines
the  following  roots for  the  registry:   classes_root,  current_user,
local_machine and users

This  library  deals  with the  analysis  and  construction  of  a  URL,
UUniversal  RResource  LLocator.    URL  is  the  basis  for  communicating
locations of resources (data) on the web.  A URL  consists of a protocol
identifier  (e.g. HTTP,  FTP), and  a  protocol-specific syntax  further
defining the location.  URLs are standardized in RFC-1738.

The implementation in  this library covers only  a small portion of  the
defined protocols.  Though the initial  implementation followed RFC-1738
strictly, the current  is more relaxed to deal with  frequent violations
of the standard encountered in practical use.

This  library contains  code by  Jan Wielemaker  who  wrote the  initial
version and Lukas Faulstich who added various extensions.


ppaarrssee__uurrll((_?_U_R_L_, _?_P_a_r_t_s))
    Construct  or analyse  a _U_R_L.  _U_R_L is  an atom  holding a  URL or  a
    variable.  _P_a_r_t_s  is a list of components.  Each component is of the
    format Name(_V_a_l_u_e).  Defined components are:

    pprroottooccooll((_P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l))
         The used  protocol.    This is,  after  the optional  url:,  an
         identifier  separated  from the  remainder  of  the  URL  using
         :.   parse_url/2 assumes the  http protocol  if no protocol  is
         specified and  the  URL can  be  parsed as  a valid  HTTP  url.
         In addition  to  the RFC-1738  specified protocols,  the  file:
         protocol is supported as well.

    hhoosstt((_H_o_s_t))
         Host-name  or IP-address  on  which  the resource  is  located.
         Supported by all network-based protocols.

    ppoorrtt((_P_o_r_t))
         Integer port-number to access  on the _H_o_s_t.  This  only appears
         if  the port  is  explicitly  specified in  the  URL.  Implicit
         default  ports  (e.g.  80  for  HTTP)  do  _n_o_t  appear  in  the
         part-list.

    ppaatthh((_P_a_t_h))
         (File-) path addressed  by the URL.  This is supported for  the
         ftp, http and file protocols.  If no path  appears, the library
         generates the path /.

    sseeaarrcchh((_L_i_s_t_O_f_N_a_m_e_V_a_l_u_e))
         Search-specification of HTTP  URL. This is  the part after  the
         ?, normally used to transfer data from HTML forms  that use the
         `GET' protocol.   In the URL it consists of  a www-form-encoded
         list of _N_a_m_e=_V_a_l_u_e pairs.   This is mapped to a list  of Prolog
         _N_a_m_e=_V_a_l_u_e terms with decoded names and values.

    ffrraaggmmeenntt((_F_r_a_g_m_e_n_t))
         Fragment specification of HTTP URL. This is the  part after the
         # character.

    The example below illustrates the all this for an HTTP UTL.

    ?- parse_url('http://swi.psy.uva.nl/message.cgi?msg=Hello+World%21#x',
                 P).
    P = [ protocol(http),
          host('swi.psy.uva.nl'),
          fragment(x),
          search([ msg = 'Hello World!'
                 ]),
          path('/message.cgi')
        ].

    By  instantiating  the  parts-list this  predicate  can be  used  to
    create a URL.

    Same  as parse_url/2,  but dealing  a url  that is  relative to  the
    given  _B_a_s_e_U_R_L. This is used to analyse or construct a URI  found in
    the document behind _B_a_s_e_U_R_L.

    Similar to  parse_url/2, but only deals with the  location part of an
    HTTP  URL. That is,  the path, search and  fragment specifiers.   In
    the HTTP protocol, the first line of a message is

         _A_c_t_i_o_n _L_o_c_a_t_i_o_n [HTTP/_H_t_t_p_V_e_r_s_i_o_n]

    _L_o_c_a_t_i_o_n is either an atom or a code-list.

    Translate  between   a  string-literal  and  the  x-www-form-encoded
    representation  used in path and  search specifications of the  HTTP
    protocol.

    Encoding  implies  mapping space  to +,  preserving  alpha-numercial
    characters,  map newlines to %0D%0A  and anything else to %XX.  When
    decoding, newlines appear as a single newline (10) character.

This  appendix  describes  a  number  of  predicates  which  enable  the
Prolog  user  to  inspect the  Prolog  environment  and  manipulate  (or
even redefine)  the debugger.    They can be  used as  entry points  for
experiments with debugging  tools for Prolog.  The  predicates described
here should  be handled  with some  care as it  is easy  to corrupt  the
consistency of the Prolog system by misusing them.

    Obtain  information  about  the local  stack  frame  _F_r_a_m_e.    _F_r_a_m_e
    is  a  frame reference  as obtained  through prolog_current_frame/1,

    ggooaall
         _V_a_l_u_e is unified with the  goal associated with _F_r_a_m_e.   If the

    lleevveell
         _V_a_l_u_e is unified  with the recursion level  of _F_r_a_m_e.  The  top
         level frame is at level `0'.

    ppaarreenntt
         _V_a_l_u_e is unified with an integer reference to  the parent local

    ttoopp
         _V_a_l_u_e is  unified with  true if _F_r_a_m_e  is the  top Prolog  goal
         from a recursive  call back from the  foreign language.   false
         otherwise.

    hhiiddddeenn
         _V_a_l_u_e is  unified with  true if the  frame is  hidden from  the

    ppcc
         _V_a_l_u_e is unified with  the program-pointer saved on behalve  of

         _V_a_l_u_e is  unified with the _N-th  slot of the  frame.   Argument
         1 is  the first  argument of  the goal.    Arguments above  the

    from  the SWI-Prolog debugger just before it would show a port.   If
    this  predicate succeeds the debugger  assumes the trace action  has
    been  taken care of and continues execution as described  by _A_c_t_i_o_n.
    Otherwise the normal Prolog debugger actions are performed.

    _P_o_r_t  is one  of call,  redo,  exit, fail  or unify.    _F_r_a_m_e is  an
    integer  reference to  the current  local stack frame.    _P_C is  the
    current  value  of the  program-counter, relative  to  the start  of
    the  current clause,  or 0  if it  is invalid,  for example  because
    the  current frame runs a foreign  predicate, or no clause has  been
    selected  yet.    _A_c_t_i_o_n should  be unified  with one  of the  atoms
    continue  (just continue execution), retry (retry the  current goal)
    or fail (force the  current goal to fail).  Leaving it a variable is
    identical to continue.

    Together  with  the predicates  described in  section  3.42 and  the
    other  predicates of this chapter this predicate enables  the Prolog
    user  to define a complete new debugger in Prolog.  Besides  this it
    enables  the Prolog programmer monitor  the execution of a  program.
    The  example below records  all goals trapped  by the tracer in  the
    database.

    prolog_trace_interception(Port, Frame, _PC, continue) :-
            prolog_frame_attribute(Frame, goal, Goal),
            prolog_frame_attribute(Frame, level, Level),
            recordz(trace, trace(Port, Level, Goal)).

    To  trace the execution of `go' this way the following  query should
    be given:

    ?- trace, go, notrace.

    level  according to _N_e_w.   New  is an integer,  or the special  atom
    very_deep  (meaning don't  skip).    The `skip  level' is  a  global
    variable  of the  Prolog system  that disables the  debugger on  all
    recursion  levels deeper than  the level of the  variable.  Used  to
    implement  the trace options  `skip' (sets skip  level to the  level
    of  the frame) and `up' (sets skip level to the level of  the parent
    frame (i.e. the level of this frame minus 1).

This section describes  the predicate exception/3, which may  be defined
by the  user in the module  user as a multifile  predicate.  Unlike  the
name  suggests, this  is  actually a  _h_o_o_k predicate.    Exceptions  are
handled by  the ISO  predicates catch/3 and  throw/1.   They all  frames
created after the matching catch/3 to be discarded immediately.

The  predicate exception/3  is  called by  the  kernel  on a  couple  of
events,  allowing the user  to alter  the behaviour  on some  predefined
events.

    Dynamic  predicate,  normally not  defined.   Called  by the  Prolog
    system  on run-time exceptions.  Currently exception/3 is  only used
    for  trapping undefined  predicates.   Future versions might  handle

         If _E_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n is undefined_predicate _C_o_n_t_e_x_t is  instantiated to
         a term  _N_a_m_e/_A_r_i_t_y.    _N_a_m_e refers  to the  name  and _A_r_i_t_y  to
         the  arity of  the  undefined predicate.    If  the  definition
         module of  the predicate is  not _u_s_e_r, _C_o_n_t_e_x_t  will be of  the

         will generate an  esistence_error exception.  If the  predicate
         succeeds it should instantiate the last argument  either to the
         atom fail to tell Prolog to fail the predicate,  the atom retry
         to tell  Prolog to  retry the predicate  or error  to make  the
         system generate  an exception.    The action  retry only  makes
         sense if the exception handler has defined the predicate.

Some libraries  realise an entirely new  programming paradigm on top  of
Prolog.   An example is  XPCE which adds  an object-system to Prolog  as
well as an extensive  set of graphical primitives.   SWI-Prolog provides
several hooks to  improve the integration of  such libraries.  See  also
section 3.4  for editing hooks  and section 3.9.3  for hooking into  the
message system.

    of  the  tracer in  the module  user to  list  the currently  called

    Hook for the  debugger-control predicates that allows the creator of
    more  high-level programming languages  to use the common  front-end
    predicates  to control de  debugger.  For  example, XPCE uses  these
    hooks  to allow for spying methods  rather then predicates.   _A_c_t_i_o_n
    is one of:

    ssppyy((_S_p_e_c))
         Hook in  spy/1.  If  the hook succeeds  spy/1 takes no  further
         action.

         Hook in nospy/1.   If the hook succeeds spy/1 takes  no further
         action.    If  spy/1  is  hooked,  it is  adviced  to  place  a

         report the status of the additional debug-points  controlled by
         the above hooks  and fail to let  the system report the  others
         or it succeed, overruling the entire behaviour of debugging/0.

    Predicates  can be published (_e_x_p_o_r_t_e_d)  and _i_m_p_o_r_t_e_d to make  their
    definition available to other modules.

mmoodduullee ttrraannssppaarreenntt [[pprreeddiiccaattee]]
    A  _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e that  does not change  the _c_o_n_t_e_x_t  _m_o_d_u_l_e.   Sometimes
    also called a _m_e_t_a _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e.

mmuullttiiffiillee [[pprreeddiiccaattee]]
    Predicate  for which  the  definition is  distributed over  multiple
    source-files.  See multi_file/1.

nneecckk
    Operator (:-) separating _h_e_a_d from _b_o_d_y in a _c_l_a_u_s_e.

ooppeerraattoorr
    Symbol (_a_t_o_m) that  may be placed before its _o_p_e_r_a_n_t (prefix), after
    its _o_p_e_r_a_n_t (postfix) or between its two _o_p_e_r_a_n_t_s (infix).

    In  Prolog, the expression a+b is exactly the same as  the canonical
    term +(a,b).

ooppeerraanntt
    _A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t of an _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r.

pprreecceeddeennccee
    The  _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y  of an  _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r.    Operator  precedence is  used  to
    interpret a+b*c as +(a, *(b,c)).

pprreeddiiccaattee
    Collection  of _c_l_a_u_s_e_s  with the same  _f_u_n_c_t_o_r (name/_a_r_i_t_y).   If  a
    _g_o_a_l  is proved,  the system  looks for  a _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e  with the  same
    functor,  then used  _i_n_d_e_x_i_n_g to select  candidate _c_l_a_u_s_e_s and  then
    tries these _c_l_a_u_s_e_s one-by-one.  See also _b_a_c_k_t_r_a_c_k_i_n_g.

pprriioorriittyy
    In the context of _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r_s a synonym for _p_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_c_e.

pprrooggrraamm
    Collection of _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_s.

pprrooppeerrttyy
    Attribute  of  an object.    SWI-Prolog  defines  various _*___p_r_o_p_e_r_t_y
    predicates to query the status of predicates, clauses.  etc.

pprroovvee
    Process  where Prolog attempts to prove a _q_u_e_r_y using  the available
    _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_s.

ppuubblliicc lliisstt
    List of _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_s exported from a _m_o_d_u_l_e.

qquueerryy
    See _g_o_a_l.

rreettrraacctt
    Remove  a _c_l_a_u_s_e from a  _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e.   See also _d_y_n_a_m_i_c, _u_p_d_a_t_e  _v_i_e_w
    and _a_s_s_e_r_t.

sshhaarreedd
    Two  _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s  are called  _s_h_a_r_e_d after  they are  _u_n_i_f_i_e_d.    This
    implies  if either of them is _b_o_u_n_d, the other is bound to  the same
    value:

    ?- A = B, A = a.

    A = a,
    B = a

ssiinngglleettoonn [[vvaarriiaabbllee]]
    _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e  appearing only one time in a _c_l_a_u_s_e.   SWI-Prolog normally
    warns  for  this to  avoid  you  making spelling  mistakes.    If  a
    variable  appears on purpose only  once in a  clause, write it as  _
    (see  _a_n_o_n_y_m_o_u_s) or make sure the first character is a _.   See also
    the style_check/1 option singletons.

ssoolluuttiioonn
    _B_i_n_d_i_n_g_s resulting from a successfully _p_r_o_v_en _g_o_a_l.

ssttrruuccttuurree
    Synonym for _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d term.

ssttrriinngg
    Used  for the  following representations  of text:   a packed  array
    (see  section 3.23, SWI-Prolog specific), a list of  character codes
    or a list of one-character _a_t_o_m_s.

ssuucccceeeedd
    A _g_o_a_l is said to have _s_u_c_c_e_e_d_e_d if it has been _p_r_o_v_e_n.

tteerrmm
    Value in Prolog.   A _t_e_r_m is either a _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e, _a_t_o_m, integer, float
    or  _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d term.   In addition,  SWI-Prolog also defines the  type
    _s_t_r_i_n_g

ttrraannssppaarreenntt
    See _m_o_d_u_l_e _t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t.

uunniiffyy
    Prolog  process to make  two terms equal  by assigning variables  in
    one term to  values at the corresponding location of the other term.
    For example:

    ?- foo(a, B) = foo(A, b).

    A = a,
    B = b

    Unlike  assignment (which does not exist in Prolog),  unification is
    not directed.

uuppddaattee vviieeww
    How  Prolog behaves when a _d_y_n_a_m_i_c _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e is changed while  it is
    running.   There are two models.   In most older Prolog  systems the
    change  becomes immediately visible to  the _g_o_a_l, in modern  systems
    including  SWI-Prolog, the running _g_o_a_l is  not affected.  Only  new
    _g_o_a_l_s `see' the new definition.

vvaarriiaabbllee
    A  Prolog  variable is  a value  that `is  not yet  bound'.    After
    _b_i_n_d_i_n_g a variable, it  cannot be modified.  _B_a_c_k_t_r_a_c_k_i_n_g to a point
    in  the execution before  the variable was  bound will turn it  back
    into a variable:

    ?- A = b, A = c.
    No
    ?- (A = b; true; A = c).
    A = b ;
    A = _G283 ;
    A = c ;
    No
